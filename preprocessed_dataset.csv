218,where was the second reported case of covid in the united states,chicago
219,is oral swab for detecting covid infection sufficient," patients infected with covid may harbour the virus in the intestine at the early or late stage of disease. it is also worth to note none of the patients with viremia blood had positive swabs. these patients would likely be considered as covid negative through routine surveillance, and thus pose a threat to other people."
220,why is important to determine the spectrum of clinical manifestations of covid infections,because it determines the strength of public health response required.
221,how do the s1 subunits compare with that of sars likecov and human sars cov,"though the s1 subunit of covid shares around 70% identity to that of the two bat sars like covs and human sars cov (figure 3(a) ), the core domain of rbd (excluding the external subdomain) are highly conserved ("

244,how to put on use take off and dispose of a mask,"before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol based hand rub or soap and water. take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes. orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is). ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the colored side). place the mask to your face. pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it molds to the shape of your nose. pull down the masks bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin."
245,What is a novel coronavirus,"A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identied. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold."
246,"Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19","On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an ocial name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, rst identied in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”. There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans."
247,How does the virus spread,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs sneezes or talks These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one
another (within about 6 feet).
"
248,"Can I get COVID-19 from food (including restaurant take-out, produce, refrigerated, or packaged food) or drinking water","Currently there is no evidence that people can get COVID-19 by eating or handling food. It may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, such as a food package or dining ware that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. There is also no current evidence that people can get COVID-19 by drinking water. The COVID-19 virus has not been detected in drinking water. Conventional water treatment methods that use ltration and disinfection, such as those in most municipal drinking water systems, should remove or kill the virus that causes COVID-19."
249,Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19,"It is not yet known whether weather and temperature aect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and u, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing."
250,What is community spread,"Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread dierently based on local conditions. For information on community spread in your area, please visit your health department’s website."
251,Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19,"At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person. See How Coronavirus Spreads for more information."
252,Does CDC recommend the use of masks to prevent COVID-19,"Wear masks in public settings when around people not living in your household and particularly where other social distancing measures are dicult to maintain, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and gas stations. Masks may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. COVID-19 can be spread by people who do not have symptoms and do not know that they are infected. That’s why it’s important for everyone to practice social distancing (staying at least 6 feet away from other people) and wear masks in public settings. Masks provide an extra layer to help prevent the respiratory droplets from traveling in the air and onto other people.The masks recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be
reserved for healthcare workers and other medical rst responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
"
253,Is it safe to get care for my other medical conditions during this time,"It is important to continue taking care of your health and wellness. Continue your medications, and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider. Continue to manage your disease the way your healthcare provider has told you. Have at least a 2-week supply of all prescription and non-prescription medications. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations are up-to-date. Call your healthcare provider if you have any concerns about your medical conditions, or if you get sick. to nd out about dierent ways you can connect with your healthcare provider for chronic disease management or other conditions. Do not delay getting emergency care for your health problems or any health condition that requires immediate attention. If you need emergency help, call 911. Emergency departments have infection prevention plans to protect you from getting COVID-19 if you need care for your medical condition. Continue to practice everyday prevention. Wash your hands often, avoid close contact, wear a mask, cover coughs and sneezes, and clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces often."
254,"Am I at risk for COVID-19 from mail, packages, or products","There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads. Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads."
255,Is it okay for me to donate blood,"In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and sta safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time."
256,Should contact lens wearers take special precautions to prevent COVID-19,"Currently there is no evidence to suggest contact lens wearers are more at risk for acquiring COVID-19 than eyeglass wearers. Contact lens wearers should continue to practice safe contact lens wear and care hygiene habits to help prevent against transmission of any contact lens-related infections, such as always washing hands with soap and water before handling lenses. People who are healthy can continue to wear and care for their contact lenses as prescribed by their eye care professional."
257,Is contact lens disinfecting solution eective against COVID-19,"Hydrogen peroxide-based systems for cleaning, disinfecting, and storing contact lenses should be eective against the virus that causes COVID-19. For other disinfection methods, such as multipurpose solution and ultrasonic cleaners, there is currently not enough scientic evidence to determine ecacy against the virus. Always use solution to disinfect your contact lenses and case to kill germs that may be present. Handle your lenses over a surface that has been cleaned and disinfected."
258,Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19,"Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol."
259,What cleaning products should I use to protect against COVID-19,"Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work. See CDC’s recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection"
260,What should I do if I get sick or someone in my house gets sick,"Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including: Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care. Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible).Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or
sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash
hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
Provide your sick household member with clean disposable facemasks to wear at home, if available, to help prevent
spreading COVID-19 to others.
Clean the sick room and bathroom, as needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person.
However, some people may need emergency medical attention. Watch for symptoms and learn when to seek emergency
medical attention.
When to Seek Emergency Medical Attention
Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical
care immediately
Trouble breathing
Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
New confusion
Inability to wake or stay awake
Bluish lips or face
*This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or
concerning to you.
Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has
or may have COVID-19."
261,What should I do if I have had close contact with someone who has COVID-19,"Be alert for symptoms. Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19. Take your temperature and follow CDC guidance if you have symptoms."
262,What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19,"Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. However, a few children have developed multisystem inammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Currently, information about this syndrome is limited. CDC is working with state and local health departments to learn more about MIS-C."
263,How can I protect my child from COVID-19 infection,"You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care. Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throw the tissue in the trash.Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects, like tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and
cabinet handles)."
264,Are the symptoms of COVID-19 dierent in children than in adults,"No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. COVID-19 can look dierent in dierent people. For many people, being sick with COVID-19 would be a little bit like having the u. People can get a fever, cough, or have a hard time taking deep breaths. Most people who have gotten COVID-19 have not gotten very sick. Only a small group of people who get it have had more serious problems. CDC and partners are investigating cases of multisystem inammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19."
265,Should children wear masks,"CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a mask that covers their nose and mouth in public settings when around people not living in your household, particularly where other social distancing measures are dicult to maintain. Masks should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suocation. Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance."
266,How do I prepare my children in case of COVID-19 outbreak in our community,"Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. When you talk with your child, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe. Talk to your children about COVID-19 and help them cope with stress."
267,What is multisystem inammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and who is at risk,"Multisystem inammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a condition where dierent body parts can become inamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. We do not yet know what causes MIS-C. However, we know that many children with MIS-C had the virus that causes COVID-19, or had been around someone with COVID-19. MIS-C can be serious, even deadly, but most children who were diagnosed with this condition have gotten better with medical care. Contact your child’s doctor, nurse, or clinic right away if your child is showing symptoms of MIS-C. Seek emergency care right away if your child is showing any of these emergency warning signs of MIS-C or other concerning signs."
268,Can my child hang out with their friends,"The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. While school is out, children should not have in-person playdates with children from other households. If children are playing outside their own homes, it is essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household. Some children with certain underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Make sure children practice everyday preventive behaviors, such as washing their hands often with soap and water. Remember, if children meet outside of school in groups, it can put everyone at risk."
269,How can I help my child continue learning,"Stay in touch with your child’s school. Many schools are oering lessons online (virtual learning). Review assignments from the school, and help your child establish a reasonable pace for completing the work. You may need to assist your child with turning on devices, reading instructions, and typing answers. Create a schedule and routine for learning at home, but remain exible. Consider the needs and adjustment required for your child’s age group. The transition to being at home will be dierent for preschoolers, K-5, middle school students, and high school students. Talk to your child about expectations and how they are adjusting to being at home versus at school. Look for ways to make learning fun."
270,Will kids have access to school meals,Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal. Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
271,How can I keep my children healthy,Watch your child for any signs of illness. Watch for signs of stress in your child. Teach and reinforce everyday preventive actions. Help your child stay active. Help your child stay socially connected.
272,"Limit time with older adults, including relatives, and people with chronic medical conditions","Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID19. If others in your home are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, consider extra precautions to separate your child from those people. If you are unable to stay home with your child during school dismissals and someone at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 will be providing care (older adult or someone with a serious underlying medical condition), limit your children’s contact with other people. Consider postponing visits or trip to see older family members and grandparents. Connect virtually or by writing letters and sending via mail."
273,Is my child with an underlying medical condition at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19,"It’s not known yet whether all children with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID19. Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens. Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition. The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system. This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19. More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk. CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed."
274,What additional steps should families that have a child with an underlying medical condition take,"In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick and running essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons with higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness and steps outlined for those with potential COVID-19 exposure or conrmed illness. Identify potential alternative caregivers, if you or other regular caregivers become sick and are unable to care for your child. If possible, these alternative caregivers would not be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 themselves. Try to have at least one month of medication and medical supplies on hand. Some health plans allow for a 90-day supply of prescription medications. Consider discussing this option with your child’s healthcare provider. Review any care plans for your child, such as an asthma action plan, and make sure caregivers and backup caregivers are familiar with these plans. If you do not have care plans or an emergency notebook, try to make them. They typically include important information about your child’s medical conditions, how to manage those conditions, how to get in touch with your child’s doctors, allergies, information on medications (names, dosages, and administration instructions), preferences (food and other) or special needs, daily routines and activities, friends, and details about routines that are important to support behavioral and emotional health. Learn if your child’s healthcare providers, including doctors and therapists, have new ways to be contacted or new ways of providing appointments. If they oer telemedicine visits, nd out how those are arranged and any additional information you need. If your child receives any support care services in the home that need to be continued, make plans for what you will do if those direct care providers get sick, or if persons in your household are sick. Discuss with the support care agencies and the providers ways to minimize risk for exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. If your child or other persons in your household are sick with COVID-19 and are able to recover at home, inform your direct care providers and consider postponing or rescheduling services until the criteria for discontinuing home isolation have been met. Ask service providers if they are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19, or if they have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19. Tell the service provider to: Wear a mask if they will be close (less than 6 feet) to you or persons in your household. Their mask helps protect you if they are infected but do not have symptoms. Ask them to wash their hands with soap and water or, if unavailable, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when they enter your home, before and after helping your child (dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, toileting and/or diapering, feeding), after handling tissues, and after changing linens or doing laundry. Learn more about proper handwashing. Service providers and families should: Routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom xtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, bedside tables), and equipment such as wheelchairs, scooters, walkers, oxygen tanks and tubing, communication boards, and other assistive devices. Refer to CDC’s recommendations for Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Home."
275,What can I do if my child has diculties adjusting to new routines and following recommendations,"Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing masks, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs. Keeping children at home can lower stress created by social distancing and mask recommendations. Reach out to others for help in running essential errands.Behavioral techniques can be used to address behavioral challenges and to develop new routines. These include social stories, video modeling, picture schedules, and visual cues. Try rewarding your child in small ways with his or her favorite non-food treat or activities to help switch routines and to follow recommendations. Many of the organizations you turn to for information and support around your child’s complex, chronic medical condition may have information on their websites to help families address issues related to COVID-19. Your child’s therapist(s) and teachers may also have resources to help successfully introduce new routines to your child. While learning at home, continue special education services, accommodations, or services received in school through your child’s 504 plan or Individualized Educational Plan (IEP), as much as possible. Many schools are continuing interventions like speech therapy, small group classes, extended time and more. Learn more about supporting children with distance learning."
276,How can my family cope with the added stress,"Supporting children with special healthcare needs can put additional demands and stress on families, especially during emergency situations. You have likely found ways to manage the stress and challenges unique to your family’s situation. It is important to continue your family’s coping methods, including reaching out to other family members, friends, support groups, and organizations that have been helpful in the past. See information on helping children cope and coping with stress (such as visiting parks, trails, or open spaces) and making your family stronger. If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others: Call 911 Visit the Disaster Distress Helpline , call 1-800-985-5990, or text TalkWithUs to 66746 Visit the National Domestic Violence Hotline or call 1-800-799-7233 and TTY 1-800-787-3224"
277,What if my child or someone else in the home is sick with symptoms of COVID-19,"If your child with special healthcare needs becomes sick with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your child’s healthcare provider. If your child has new or worsening emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to wake them up, or bluish lips or face, call 911. If you think your child may have COVID-19, notify the operator so that rst responders may be appropriately prepared to protect themselves and others. Notify your child’s healthcare provider if someone else in your house becomes sick with COVID-19, so they can provide any advice specic for your child."
278,"What if my child’s symptoms of their underlying medical condition or complex, chronic medical condition get worse","Call your child’s healthcare provider if you have any concerns about your child’s medical conditions. If you need emergency help, call 911. Emergency departments have infection prevention plans to protect you and your child from getting COVID-19 if your child needs care for medical conditions not related to COVID-19. Do not delay getting emergency care for your child’s underlying condition or complex medical condition because you are afraid of getting exposed to COVID-19 when visiting the healthcare setting."
279,What if my child needs to go to the hospital,"If your child’s healthcare provider tells you to go to the hospital for any health problem, including COVID-19 Ask the healthcare provider to let the hospital know you are coming and to share important information about caring
for your child.
Visiting policies may have changed due to COVID-19. If your child’s hospital policy does not allow an adult to stay with
a child, ask your child’s healthcare provider for a statement explaining your child’s need for a familiar adult to be
present.
Bring your care plans/emergency notebook with you along with paper and pen to write down questions you have
during your time at the hospital."
280,How can I prepare for an outbreak in my area,"Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community: Talk with the people who need to be included in your plan, and discuss what to do if a COVID-19 outbreak occurs in your community. Plan ways to care for those who might be at greater risk for serious complications. Make sure they have access to 2 weeks of medications and supplies in case you need to stay home for prolonged periods of time. Get to know your neighbors and nd out if your neighborhood has a website or social media page to stay connected. Create a list of local organizations that you and your household can contact in the event you need access to information, healthcare services, support, and resources. Create an emergency contact list of family, friends, neighbors, carpool drivers, health care providers, teachers, employers, the local public health department, and other community resources"
281,How can I prepare for COVID-19 at work,"Plan for potential changes at your workplace. Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options. Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19."
282,Should I make my own hand sanitizer if I can’t nd it in the stores,"CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredients and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product. Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to ll in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidance. Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available. To be eective against killing some types of germs, hand sanitizers need to have a strength of at least 60% alcohol and be used when hands are not visibly dirty or greasy. Do not rely on “Do It Yourself” or “DIY” recipes based solely on essential oils or formulated without correct compounding practices.
Do not use hand sanitizer to disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects."
283,What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause,"People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms – from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. If you have fever, cough, or other symptoms, you might have COVID-19."
284,When should I seek emergency care if I have COVID-19,"Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest New confusion Inability to wake or stay awake Bluish lips or face *This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you. Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19."
285,Is it possible to have the u and COVID-19 at the same time,Yes. It is possible to test positive for u (as well as other respiratory infections) and COVID-19 at the same time.
286,Should I be tested for a current infection,"Maybe; not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider rst. Most people will have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care and may not need to be tested. CDC has guidance for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are made by state and local health departments and healthcare providers."
287,How can I get tested for a current infection (viral test) and what does my test mean,"Decisions about testing are made by state and local health departments or healthcare providers. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and are not tested, it is important to stay home."
288,What to do if you are sick,"COVID-19 testing diers by location. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider rst. You can also visit your state or local health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized viral tests that let you collect either a nasal swab or a saliva sample at home. However, you will still need to send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.If you test positive for COVID-19, know what protective steps to take if you are sick or caring for someone.If you test negative for COVID-19, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that
does not mean you will not get sick. The test result only means that you did not have COVID-19 at the time of testing. You
might test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during your illness. You could
also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. This means you could still spread the virus. If you
develop symptoms later, you might need another test to determine if you are infected with the virus that causes COVID19.
"
289,How can I get tested for a past infection (antibody test) and what does my test mean,"Antibody tests for COVID-19 are available through healthcare providers and laboratories. Check with your healthcare provider to see if they oer antibody tests and whether you should get one. A positive test result shows you might have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold. Having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 might provide protection from getting infected with the virus again. If it does, we do not know how much protection the antibodies might provide or how long this protection might last. You should continue to protect yourself and others since you could get infected with the virus again. If you test negative, you might not have ever had COVID-19. Talk with your healthcare provider about your test result and the type of test you took to understand what your result means. Regardless of whether you test positive or negative, the results do not conrm whether or not you are able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others."
290,Can someone test negative and later test positive on a viral test for COVID-19,"Yes, it is possible. You may test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during this illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. Even if you test negative, you still should take steps to protect yourself and others."
291,Who is at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19,"COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19."
292,What should people at higher risk of serious illness with COVID-19 do,"If you are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, you should: Limit your interactions with other people as much as possible. Take precautions to prevent getting COVID-19 when you do interact with others. If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions.Keep these items on hand and use them when venturing out: a mask, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60%
alcohol, if possible.
If possible, avoid others who are not wearing masks or ask others around you to wear masks.
Delay or cancel a visit if you or your visitors have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with
COVID-19 in the last 14 days.
Anyone who has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should stay home and monitor for symptoms.
Continue your medicines and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider.
Have at least a 30-day supply of prescription and non-prescription medicines.
Do not delay getting emergency care for your underlying medical condition because of COVID-19. Emergency
departments have contingency infection prevention plans to protect you from getting COVID-19 if you need care.
"
293,Are people with disabilities at higher risk,"Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19. Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition. People with certain disabilities might experience higher rates of chronic health conditions that put them at higher risk of serious illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19. Adults with disabilities are three times more likely to have heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer than adults without disabilities. You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed."
294,What is contact tracing,"Contact tracing has been used for decades by state and local health departments to slow or stop the spread of infectious diseases. Contact tracing slows the spread of COVID-19 by Letting people know they may have been exposed to COVID-19 and should monitor their health for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 Helping people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 get tested Asking people to self-isolate if they have COVID-19 or self-quarantine if they are a close contact of someone with COVID-19 During contact tracing, the health department sta will not ask you for Money Social Security number Bank account information Salary information Credit card numbers"
295,What will happen with my personal information during contact tracing,"Discussions with health department sta are condential. This means that your personal and medical information will be kept private and only shared with those who may need to know, like your health care provider.
If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, your name will not be shared with those you came in contact with. The health
department will only notify people you were in close contact with (within 6 feet for more than 15 minutes) that they might
have been exposed to COVID-19. Each state and jurisdiction use their own method for collecting and protecting health
information. To learn more, contact your state or local health department.
"
296,Who is considered a close contact to someone with COVID-19,"For COVID-19, a close contact is anyone who was within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes. An infected person can spread COVID-19 starting 48 hours (or 2 days) before the person had any symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19."
297,Am I considered a close contact if I was wearing a mask,"Yes, you are still considered a close contact even if you were wearing a mask while you were around someone with COVID-19. Masks are meant to protect other people in case you are infected, and not to protect you from becoming infected."
298,"If I am a close contact, will I be tested for COVID-19","If you have been around someone who is sick with COVID-19, local authorities, the health department, or your doctor may recommend that you get tested for COVID-19. The health department may be able to provide resources for testing in your area. While you are waiting for your COVID-19 test result, stay home away from others (self-quarantine) and monitor your health for symptoms of COVID-19 to protect your friends, family, and others from possibly getting COVID-19. If your test is positive, you should continue to stay home and self-isolate away from others and monitor your health. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and they worsen or become severe, you should seek emergency medical care. Severe symptoms include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or bluish lips or face. Someone from the health department may call you to Check on your health, Discuss who you have been around, and Ask where you have spent time while you may have been able to spread COVID-19 to others. If your test is negative and you don’t have symptoms, you should continue to stay home and self-quarantine away from others for 14 days after your last exposure to COVID-19 and follow all recommendations from the health department. This is important because symptoms can appear up to 14 days after you’ve been exposed and are infected. A negative result before the end of your quarantine period does not rule out possible infection. Additionally, you do not need a repeat test unless you develop symptoms, or if you require a test to return to work. If your test is negative and you have symptoms, you should continue to self-quarantine away from others for 14 days after your last exposure to COVID-19 and follow all recommendations from the health department. Additional medical consultation and a second test may be needed if your symptoms do not improve."
299,What will happen during contact tracing if I am diagnosed with COVID-19,"If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, someone from the health department may call you to check on your health, discuss who you have been around, and ask where you spent time while you may have been able to spread COVID-19 to others. You will also be asked to continue to stay at home and self-isolate, away from others. Your name will not be shared with those you came in contact with. The health department sta will not ask you for Money Social Security number
Bank account information
Salary information, or
Credit card numbers
Self-isolation means staying at home in a specic room away from other people and pets, and using a separate
bathroom, if possible.
Self-isolation helps slow the spread of COVID-19 and can help protect the health of your family, friends, neighbors,
and others you may come in contact.
If you need support or assistance while in self-isolation, your health department or community organizations may be
able to provide assistance.
Watch for or monitor your symptoms of COVID-19. If your symptoms worsen or become severe, you should seek medical
care.
"
300,What will happen during contact tracing if I have been around someone with COVID-19,"If you were around someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, someone from the health department may call you to let you know that you may have been exposed to COVID-19. Stay home away from others for 14 days (self-quarantine) after your last contact with that person. Health department sta will help identify the dates for your self-quarantine. Health department sta can also provide resources for COVID19 testing in your area. Self-quarantine means staying home away from others and monitoring your health. If you need to be around other people or animals in or outside of the home, wear a mask. This will help protect the people around you. If you need support or assistance while in self-quarantine, your health department or community organizations may be able to provide assistance. Monitor your health and watch for symptoms of COVID-19. Remember, symptoms may appear 2-14 days after you were exposed to COVID-19. Tell the health department if you develop any symptoms. Tell people you were around recently if you become ill, so they can monitor their health. If your symptoms worsen or become severe, seek medical care. Severe symptoms include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or bluish lips or face. The health department sta will not ask you for Money Social Security number Bank account information Salary information, or Credit card numbers"
301,"I was around someone who has COVID-19, and my COVID-19 test came back negative. Do I still need to quarantine for 14 days after I was last exposed","Yes. You should still self-quarantine for 14 days since your last exposure. It can take up to 14 days after exposure to the virus for a person to develop COVID-19 symptoms. A negative result before end of the 14-day quarantine period does not rule out possible infection. By self-quarantining for 14 days, you lower the chance of possibly exposing others to COVID19."
302,"I was recently around someone who has COVID-19, but I feel ne. Why should I stay at home","People with COVID-19 can still spread the virus even if they don’t have any symptoms. If you were around someone who had COVID-19, it is critical that you stay home and away from others for 14 days from the last day that you were around that person. Staying home and away from others at all times helps your health department in the ght against COVID-19
and helps protect you, your family, and your community.
"
303,What if I have been around someone who was identied as a close contact,"If you have been around someone who was identied as a close contact to a person with COVID-19, closely monitor yourself for any symptoms of COVID-19. You do not need to self-quarantine unless you develop symptoms or if the person identied as a close contact develops COVID-19."
304,Will there be a national app for contact tracing,"No, there will not be a national app for contact tracing. There are many options available now, and it is up to each state and individual to decide which tools best t their needs."
305,"If I participate in contact tracing for COVID-19 using a digital tool, is my personal health information secure","Yes, if you agree to participate in contact tracing for COVID-19 with the health department, your information is secure. Discussions with health department sta are condential. This means that your personal and medical information will be kept private and only shared with those who may need to know, like your health care provider. Your name will not be shared with those you came in contact with. If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the health department will only notify people you were in close contact with (within 6 feet for more than 15 minutes) that they might have been exposed to COVID-19. Health departments may use case management tools to help make the contact tracing process more ecient. If you choose to provide information through one of these tools, your information is secure and stored with the health department. These tools also help health departments quickly receive and analyze information about COVID-19. Case management tools are under the same laws and regulations for all sensitive health information use (e.g. HIPPA). You must provide consent for the health department to collect information using a case management tool. Just like traditional contact tracing, digital tools will not collect information regarding money, Social Security numbers, bank account information, salary information, or credit card numbers. Exposure notication tools may be an app that you can download on your personal cell phone. If you choose to download an exposure notication app for COVID-19, your information is secure. Exposure notication apps are developed in collaboration with or endorsed by health departments. These apps undergo rigorous testing to determine their trustworthiness, security, and ability to protect people’s privacy. Until you give consent to share information with your local health department, any information you have entered into the app is stored only on your personal phone. Your information is stored only on your own phone and is not sent to the health department or any other third party. The app and your information can be deleted any time. When you consent to share your information with the local health"
306,Will I be required to download a contact tracing app for COVID-19 on my phone,"No, you are not required to download an app to give information for contact tracing for COVID-19. Health departments commonly use case management tools to make the contact tracing process more ecient. These types of tools are not downloaded on personal cell phones. If you choose to give information to your local or state health department for contact tracing for COVID-19, you do not need to download an app on your cell phone. The health department sta may call you to Check on your health, Discuss who you have been around, and Ask where you have spent time while you may have been able to spread COVID-19 to others. It is up to you to decide if you download an exposure notication app for COVID-19."
307,Am I at risk if I go to a funeral or visitation service for someone who died of COVID-19,There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19.
308,Am I at risk if I touch someone who died of COVID-19 after they have passed away,"COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. This type of spread is not a concern after death. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home sta on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of uids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, face shield, or goggles and N-95 respirator)."
309,How can loved ones safely handle belongings of someone who died from COVID-19,"If desired, you may retrieve the belongings of a loved one who has died of COVID-19 outside their home (for example, in a hospital setting). Depending on local rules and regulations, family members may retrieve these belongings at the funeral home or the healthcare facility. You should use gloves and practice good hand hygiene when handling your loved ones’ belongings. Depending on the type of belongings, such as electronics, you should also follow the household item-specic cleaning and disinfection guidelines when handling these items."
310,What should I do if my family member died from COVID-19 while overseas,"When a US citizen dies outside the United States, the deceased person’s next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular ocials at the Department of State. Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies. If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a dierent country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of State’s Oce of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444. For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty ocer. In addition, the US embassy closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance."
311,My family member died from COVID-19 while overseas. What are the requirements for returning the body to the United States,"CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy. Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceased’s employer. There likely will need to be an ocial identication of the body and ocial
documents issued by the consular oce.
CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the
person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the
standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and
authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:
The remains are cremated; OR
The remains are properly embalmed and placed in a leak-proof container; OR
The remains are accompanied by a permit issued by the CDC Director. The CDC permit (if applicable) must accompany
the human remains at all times during shipment.
Permits for the importation of the remains of a person known or suspected to have died from a quarantinable communicable disease may be obtained through the CDC Division of Global Migration and Quarantine by calling the CDC Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100 or emailing dgmqpolicyoce@cdc.gov."
312,What is the dierence between cleaning and disinfecting,"Cleaning with soap and water removes germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It lowers the risk of spreading infection. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces. By killing germs on a surface after cleaning, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection."
313,"Is it safe to vacuum in a school, business, or community facility after someone with suspected or conrmed COVID19 has been present","The risk of transmitting or spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, during vacuuming is unknown. In order to reduce the need for cleaning, disinfection, and vacuuming, consider removing area rugs completely, if possible. At this time, there are no reported cases of COVID-19 associated with vacuuming. If vacuuming is necessary or required in a school, business, or community facility that was used by a person with suspected or conrmed COVID-19, rst follow the CDC recommendations for Cleaning and Disinfection for Community Facilities that apply, which includes a wait time of 24 hours, or as long as practical. After cleaning and disinfection, the following recommendations may help reduce the risk to workers and other individuals when vacuuming: Use a vacuum equipped with a high-eciency particulate air (HEPA) lter, if available. Do not vacuum a room or space that has people in it. Wait until the room or space is empty to vacuum, such as at night, for common spaces, or during the day for private rooms. Wear disposable gloves to clean and disinfect. For soft (porous) surfaces, such as carpeted oors or rugs, clean the surface using soap and water or with cleaners appropriate for use on these surfaces, according to the textile’s label. After cleaning, disinfect with an appropriate EPA-registered disinfectant on List N: Disinfectants for use against SARSCoV-2 . Soft and porous materials, like carpet, are generally not as easy to disinfect as hard and non-porous surfaces. EPA has listed a limited number of products approved for disinfection for use on soft and porous materials on List N. Follow the disinfectant manufacturer’s safety instructions (such as wearing gloves and ensuring adequate ventilation), concentration level, application method and contact time. Allow sucient drying time if vacuum is not intended for wet surfaces. Temporarily turn o in-room, window-mounted, or on-wall recirculation HVAC to avoid contamination of the HVAC units.Do NOT deactivate central HVAC systems. These systems tend to provide better ltration capabilities and introduce
outdoor air into the areas that they serve."
314,What is routine cleaning? How frequently should facilities be cleaned to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19,"Routine cleaning is the everyday cleaning practices that businesses and communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment. Surfaces frequently touched by multiple people, such as door handles, bathroom surfaces, and handrails, should be cleaned with soap and water or another detergent at least daily when facilities are in use. More frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use. For example, certain surfaces and objects in public spaces, such as shopping carts and point of sale keypads, should be cleaned and disinfected before each use. Cleaning removes dirt and impurities, including germs, from surfaces. Cleaning alone does not kill germs, but it reduces the number of germs on a surface."
315,Is cleaning alone eective against the virus that causes COVID-19,"Cleaning does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. If a surface may have gotten the virus on it from a person with or suspected to have COVID-19, the surface should be cleaned and disinfected. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces."
316,Who should clean and disinfect community spaces,Regular cleaning sta can clean and disinfect community spaces. Cleaning sta should be trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals and provided with the personal protective equipment (PPE) required for the chemicals used.
317,How long do companies need to close for disinfection after an exposure? How long before other workers can come back to work,"Companies do not necessarily need to close after a person with conrmed or suspected COVID-19 has been in a company facility. The area(s) used or visited by the ill person should be closed for 24 hours or as long as possible. Open outside doors and windows as much as possible ensuring that doing so does not pose a safety risk to children using the facility (i.e. make sure that children are not able to enter the closed o area through any windows or doors). and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Once the area has been appropriately disinfected, it can be opened for use. Workers without close contact with the person with conrmed or suspected COVID-19 can return to work immediately after disinfection is completed"
318,"How eective are alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity UV radiation, and LED blue light","The ecacy of these disinfection methods against the virus that causes COVID-19 is not known. EPA only recommends use of the surface disinfectants identied on List N against the virus that causes COVID-19. EPA does not routinely review the safety or ecacy of pesticidal devices, such as UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. Therefore, EPA cannot conrm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be eective against the spread of COVID-19."
319,"Should outdoor playgrounds, like those at schools or in parks, be cleaned and disinfected to prevent COVID-19","Outdoor areas generally require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection. Spraying disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds is not an ecient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID19 to the public. You should maintain existing cleaning and hygiene practices for outdoor areas. If practical, high touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings, should be cleaned routinely. Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (e.g., play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (e.g., mulch, sand) is not recommended."
320,Can sanitizing tunnels be used at building entrances or exits to prevent the spread of COVID-19,"CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that they are eective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage."
321,Should sidewalks and roads be disinfected to prevent COVID-19,CDC does not recommend disinfection of sidewalks or roads. Spraying disinfectant on sidewalks and roads is not an ecient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. The risk of spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not eective on these surfaces.
322,Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals,"At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a signicant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19. Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak. However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene."
323,Do I need to get my pet tested for COVID-19,"No. At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended."
324,Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur,"Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets. However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them."
325,Should I avoid contact with pets or other animals if I am sick with COVID-19,"We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations. Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including Petting Snuggling Being kissed or licked Sharing food or bedding If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a mask."
326,What animals can get COVID-19,"We don’t know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus. Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. These ndings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people. At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a signicant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. Further studies are needed to understand if and how dierent animals could be aected by the virus that causes COVID19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19."
327,Should I worry about my pet cat,"We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations. CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19. A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a signicant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking. People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus aects animals. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a mask and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets."
328,Can I walk my dog during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Walking your dog is important for both animal and human health and wellbeing. Walk dogs on a leash, and stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others. Do not gather in groups, stay out of crowded places, and avoid mass gatherings. To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk."
329,Can I take my dog to a dog park,"Dog parks provide socialization and exercise for dogs, which is an important part of their wellbeing. Because there is a small risk that people with COVID-19 could spread it to animals, CDC recommends that you do not let pets interact with people outside of your household, especially in places with community spread of COVID-19. Therefore, you should consider avoiding dog parks or other places where large numbers of people and dogs gather. Some areas are allowing dog parks to open. If you choose to go to a dog park, follow local guidelines. There are ways to reduce the risk of you or your dog getting infected with COVID-19 if you go to a dog park. Do not take your dog to a dog park if you are sick or if you have recently been in close contact with a person with COVID-19. Do not take your dog to a dog park if your dog is sick. Signs of sickness in dogs may include fever, coughing, diculty breathing or shortness of breath, lethargy, sneezing, discharge from the nose or eyes, vomiting, or diarrhea. If your dog has tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, talk to your veterinarian about when it is appropriate for your pet to go back to normal activities. Try to limit your dog’s interaction with other people outside of your household while at the dog park.As much as possible, avoid touching common items in the dog park like water bowls. Wash your hands or use hand
sanitizer after touching items from the park. To make sure your dog has fresh water, consider bringing your own
portable water bowl.
Limit other pet items brought to the dog park, such as toys. Clean and disinfect anything taken to the park and
returned home (leashes, toys, water bowls).
Do not wipe or bathe your dog with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or any other products not
approved for animal use."
330,Can I take my dog to daycare or a groomer,"Until we know more about how this virus aects animals, CDC encourages pet owners to treat pets as you would other human family members to protect them from possible infection. This means limiting contact between your pets and people outside your household as much as possible and avoiding places where large numbers of people gather. Some areas are allowing groomers and boarding facilities such as dog daycares to open. If you must take your pet to a groomer or boarding facility, follow any protocols put into place at the facility, such as wearing a mask and maintaining at least 6 feet of space between yourself and others if possible. Limit pet items brought from home to the groomer or boarding facility, and disinfect any objects that are taken into a facility and returned home (such as leashes, bowls, and toys). Use an EPA-registered disinfectant to clean items and rinse thoroughly with clean water afterwards. Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or any other products not approved for animal use. Do not put masks on pets, and do not take a sick pet to a groomer or boarding facility. Signs of sickness in animals may include: Fever Coughing Diculty breathing or shortness of breath Lethargy Sneezing Nasal/ocular discharge Vomiting Diarrhea If you think your pet is sick, call your veterinarian. Some veterinarians may oer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care."
331,What should I do if my pet gets sick and I think it’s COVID-19,"There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets. If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19. Some veterinarians may oer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care."
332,Why are animals being tested when many people can’t get tested,"Animals are only being tested in very rare circumstances. Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time,and any tests done on animals are done on a case by case basis. For example, if the pet of a COVID-19 patient has a new,
concerning illness with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, the animal’s veterinarian might consult with public health
and animal health ocials to determine if testing is needed.
"
333,Are pets from a shelter safe to adopt,"Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, play a signicant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19."
334,What should I do if there are pets at my long-term care facility or assisted living facility,"Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. However, it appears that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals after close contact with people with COVID-19. Until we learn more about how this virus aects animals, use similar precautions for pets and other animals in your facility as you would for other people in your facility. This will help protect both people and pets in your facility from COVID-19. Do not let pets in the facility interact with sick people. Pets or other animals should not be allowed to roam freely around the facility. Residents should avoid letting their pets interact with people as much as possible. Dogs should be walked on a leash at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others. People sick with COVID-19 should avoid contact with pets and other animals. Do not allow pets into common areas of the facility such as cafeterias and social areas. Cats should be kept indoors to prevent them from interacting with other animals or people outside of the facility. Talk to a veterinarian if a pet in your facility gets sick or if you have any concerns about the health of any pets in the facility. If you think a pet in the facility was exposed to or is showing signs consistent with COVID-19, contact your state health ocial to discuss guidance on testing pets or other animals for the virus that causes COVID-19. People who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 should avoid providing care for sick pets, if possible."
335,What about imported animals or animal products,"CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States. CDC regulates animals and animal products that pose a threat to human health, USDA regulate animals and animal products that pose a threat to agriculture; and FWS regulates importation of endangered species and wildlife that can harm the health and welfare of humans, the interests of agriculture, horticulture, or forestry, and the welfare and survival of wildlife resources."
336,"What precautions should be taken for animals that have recently been imported from outside the United States (for
example, by shelters, rescues, or as personal pets)","Imported animals will need to meet CDC and USDA requirements for entering the United States. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available."
337,Can wild animals spread the virus that causes COVID-19 to people or pets,"Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States. The rst case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City. However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health ocials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus. If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we don’t know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets. Further studies are needed to understand if and how dierent animals, including wildlife, could be aected by COVID-19. Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance. Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States: Keep your family, including pets, a safe distance away from wildlife. Do not feed wildlife or touch wildlife droppings. Always wash your hands and supervise children washing their hands after working or playing outside. Leave orphaned animals alone. Often, the parents are close by and will return for their young. Consult your state wildlife agency’s guidance if you are preparing or consuming legally harvested game meat. Do not approach or touch a sick or dead animal – contact your state wildlife agency instead"
338,"Can bats in United States get the virus that causes COVID-19, and can they spread it back to people","Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats. In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we don’t yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick. Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States. Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19. However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people. Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be aected by COVID-19."
339,Is hunter-harvested game meat safe to eat during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Currently, there is no evidence that you can get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 by eating food, including wild hunted game meat. However, hunters can get infected with other diseases when processing or eating game. Hunters should always practice good hygiene when processing animals by following these food safety recommendations: Do not harvest animals that appear sick or are found dead. Keep game meat clean and cool the meat down as soon as possible after harvesting the animal. Avoid cutting through the backbone and spinal tissues and do not eat the brains of any wild animal. When handling and cleaning game: Wear rubber or disposable gloves. Do not eat, drink, or smoke.When nished handling and cleaning game:
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.
Clean knives, equipment, and surfaces that were in contact with game meat with soap and water and then
disinfect them. While these recommendations apply to general food safety practices, if you are concerned about
COVID-19, you may use a product on the EPA list of disinfectants for use against the COVID-19 virus .
Cook all game meat thoroughly (to an internal temperature of 165°F or higher).
Check with your state wildlife agency regarding any testing requirements for other diseases and for any specic
instructions regarding preparing, transporting, and consuming game meat.
"
340,How can I safely run my equestrian facility,"You should follow your state and/or local jurisdictional guidance regarding continuing operations at your facility. There have not been any reports of horses testing positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. COVID19 is primarily spread from person to person, so steps should be taken to reduce the risks for people visiting your facility. Encourage employees and other visitors, including boarders, owners, farriers, veterinarians, and those taking lessons, not to enter the facility if they are sick. Employees should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, after talking with their doctor. Implement sick leave policies that are exible, nonpunitive, and consistent with public health guidance, allowing employees to stay home if they have symptoms of respiratory infection. Consider conducting daily health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees and others visiting the facility before they enter the premises. People with a fever of 100.4 (38.0 C) or above or other signs of illness should not be admitted to the premises. If implementing health checks, conduct them safely and respectfully. See General Business FAQs for more information. Employees or visitors who appear to have symptoms upon arrival or who become sick during their visit should immediately be separated from other employees and visitors and sent home. Limit the number of people entering the facility. Consider staggering lesson and visiting times to limit the number of people in the facility and potential for person-to-person contact. If possible, you can also take steps to decrease hightrac areas by limiting areas open to visitors/owners or staggering use of common areas like grooming or wash stalls and tack rooms. Increase distance and limit duration of contact between employees and visitors in the facility. Whenever possible, people should maintain at least 6 feet of distance between each other at the facility, including instructors teaching lessons. Allow for social distancing and avoid large numbers of people within the facility, including in employee-only areas. Visitors and employees should wear masks to protect others especially where social distancing measures are dicult to maintain. Wearing a mask does NOT replace the need to practice social distancing. Set up hand hygiene stations at the entrance and within the facility, so that employees and people entering can clean their hands before they enter. Employees should wash hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. An alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol can be used, but if hands are visibly dirty, they should be washed with soap and water before using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Examples of hand hygiene stations may be a hose and soap located at entrances to allow for handwashing before entry. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as grooming tools, halters, lead ropes, shared tack and equipment, and door handles/gates (including those to stall doors and pasture/turn out areas) on a routine basis. To disinfect, use products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 and are appropriate for the surface, diluted household bleach solutions prepared according to the manufacturer’s label for disinfection, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol. Follow manufacturer’s directions for use, especially regarding product contact time and protections from chemical hazards posed by cleaners and disinfectants. Follow local guidance on shelter in place and travel recommendations when traveling for showing, training, or trail riding. If traveling to a new facility, limit contact between people, horses, tack, equipment, and other supplies from dierent facilities, and maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between horses and riders. Follow state and local guidance on travel. People who are sick should not travel to other facilities. People visiting other facilities should follow the same precautions as they would normally, including maintaining at least 6 feet of distance between each other, wearing a mask to protect others, and washing hands frequently with soap and water.
If other animals, such as barn cats, are present at the facility, be aware that a small number of pets have been
reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19 .

341,What is community mitigation,"Community mitigation activities are actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases, and prepare for it if it occurs, including COVID-19. Community mitigation is especially important before a vaccine or drug becomes widely available."
342,What are community mitigation actions for COVID-19,"For individuals Washing hands often Avoiding close contact with people who are sick, and practicing social distancing Covering mouth and nose with a mask when around others Covering coughs and sneezes Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces daily For communities Promoting behaviors that prevent spread Maintaining healthy environments Maintaining healthy operations Preparing for when someone gets sick Closing businesses and schools and limiting other service"
343,Who is involved in community mitigation actions,"Individual people, communities, schools, businesses, and healthcare organizations have a role to play in community mitigation. Policies*, which include limits on large gatherings, restrictions on businesses, and school closures are often needed to fully put in place community mitigation strategies. Each community is unique. Because some actions can be very disruptive to daily life, mitigation activities will be dierent depending on how much disease has spread within the community, what the community population is like, and the ability to take these actions at the local level. To identify appropriate activities, all parts of a community that might be aected need to be considered, including populations most vulnerable to severe illness, and those who might be more aected socially or economically. When selecting mitigation activities, states and communities need to consider the spread of disease locally, characteristics of the people who live in the community (for example, age groups, languagesspoken, overall health status), and the kind of public health resources and healthcare systems (like hospitals) that are
available in the community. State and local ocials may need to adjust community mitigation activities and immediately
take steps to scale them up or down depending on the changing local situation.
Putting mitigation into practice is based on
Emphasizing individual responsibility for taking recommended personal-level actions
Empowering businesses, schools, and community organizations to take recommended actions, particularly in ways
that protect persons at increased risk of severe illness
Focusing on settings that provide critical infrastructure or services to individuals at increased risk of severe illness
Minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent possible
*CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization. CDC shares recommendations based on the best
available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety. In all cases, follow the guidance of
your healthcare provider and local health department. Local decisions depend on local circumstances.
"
344,Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread through treated drinking water,"The virus that causes COVID-19 has not been detected in treated drinking water. Water treatment plants use lters and disinfectants to remove or kill germs, like the virus that causes COVID-19. The Environmental Protection Agency regulates water treatment plants to ensure that treated water is safe to drink. Currently, there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people by drinking treated water. COVID-19 is spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person. You can continue to use and drink water from your tap as usual."
345,Is the virus that causes COVID-19 found in feces (stool),"The virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in the feces of some patients diagnosed with COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether the virus found in feces may be capable of causing COVID-19. There has not been any conrmed report of the virus spreading from feces to a person. Scientists also do not know how much risk there is that the virus could be spread from the feces of an infected person to another person. However, they think this risk is low based on data from previous outbreaks of diseases caused by related coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)."
346,Can the COVID-19 virus spread through sewerage systems,"Recently, ribonucleic acid (RNA) from the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. While data are limited, there is little evidence of infectious virus in wastewater, and no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because of exposure to wastewater. At this time, the risk of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 through properly designed and maintained sewerage systems is thought to be low."
347,Should wastewater workers take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus that causes COVID-19,"Recently, ribonucleic acid (RNA) from the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. While data are limited, there is little evidence of infectious virus in wastewater, and no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because of exposure to wastewater.Standard practices associated with wastewater treatment plant operations should be sucient to protect wastewater
workers from the virus that causes COVID-19. These standard practices can include engineering and administrative
controls, hygiene precautions, specic safe work practices, and personal protective equipment (PPE) normally required
when handling untreated wastewater. No additional COVID-19–specic protections are recommended for workers
involved in wastewater management, including those at wastewater treatment facilities.
"
348,"If my utility has issued a Boil Water Advisory, can I still use tap water to wash my hands","In most cases, it is safe to wash your hands with soap and tap water during a Boil Water Advisory. Follow the guidance from your local public health ocials. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol."
349,"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds","CDC is not aware of any scientic reports of the virus that causes COVID-19 spreading to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds. Plus, proper operation of public pools, hot tubs, and water playgrounds (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) and disinfection of the water (with chlorine or bromine) should inactivate the virus. The virus mainly spreads when respiratory droplets from infected people land in the mouths or noses of others or possibly when inhaled into the lungs by others. If a public pool, hot tub, or water playground is open, it is important for all visitors and sta to take steps to slow the spread of the virus: Stay home if you are infected or might be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Stay at least 6 feet apart (in and out of the water) from people you don’t live with. Wear cloth masks when not in water. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue (or use the inside of your elbow), throw used tissues in the trash, and wash hands. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available."
350,Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread to people through the water in saltwater pools,"CDC is not aware of any scientic reports of the virus that causes COVID-19 spreading to people through the water in pools, including saltwater pools. Plus, proper operation of public pools (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) and disinfection of the water (with chlorine or bromine) should inactivate the virus. Saltwater pools are chlorinated pools. In traditional pools, chlorine products (such as granules or liquid bleach) are added to the water to disinfect it. In saltwater pools, table salt (made up of sodium and chloride) is added to the water, and an electrical current is then run through the water with dissolved salt. This creates the same disinfecting form of chlorine that is created when chlorine products are added to the water in traditional pools."
351,"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread to people through the water in lakes, oceans, or rivers","CDC is not aware of any scientic reports of the virus that causes COVID-19 spreading to people through the water in lakes, oceans, rivers, or other natural bodies of water. The virus mainly spreads when respiratory droplets from infected people land in the mouths or noses of others or possibly when inhaled into the lungs by others. If a public beach or other swim area in a natural body of water is open, it is important for all visitors and sta to take steps to slow the spread of the virus:Stay home if you are infected or might be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
Stay at least 6 feet apart (in and out of the water) from people you don’t live with.
Wear cloth masks when not in water.
Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue (or use the inside of your elbow), throw used tissues in the trash, and wash
hands.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if
soap and water are not readily available.RNA of the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater, which can come from combined
sewer overows (rainwater runo, domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater) and other sources  (such as,
leaking septic tanks or animal waste from farms nearby) and enter swim areas. While data are limited, there is little
evidence of infectious virus in wastewater. Plus, CDC is not aware of any scientic reports of the virus being spread by
swallowing or coming in contact with water contaminated by feces (poop) from an infected person.
At lakes, oceans, and rivers with routine water quality monitoring programs, sta look for changes in fecal (poop)
contamination of the water. Water quality advisories and beach closures alert the public to avoid getting in or on the
water because of increased fecal contamination. Learn more about healthy swimming in natural bodies of water and
access water quality information by state.
"
352,Can cloth masks be worn in the water,"No, do NOT wear a cloth mask in the water. It can be dicult to breathe through a cloth mask when it is wet. Plus, wet cloth masks don’t slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 as well as dry cloth masks. All of this means it is particularly important to stay at least 6 feet apart in the water from people you don’t live with. In case cloth masks do get wet by mistake, bring a second (or extra) cloth mask for everyone heading out to the public pool or beach."
353,"Can Lycra (Spandex or elastane), the cloth used to make swimsuits, be used to make cloth masks","CDC does not yet have evidence on the eectiveness of dierent types of cloth materials. Wearing cloth masks can help prevent people infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 from spreading the virus. Make sure your cloth mask: ts snugly but comfortably against the side of the face, completely covers the nose and mouth, is secured with ties or ear loops, includes multiple layers of fabric, allows for breathing without restriction, and can be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape. Cloth masks should NOT be worn by children less than 2 years old or anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. Learn more about how to wear, take o, and wash your cloth masks."
354,"How many people, visitors and sta, can be in and around a public pool, hot tub, or water playground (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) at the same time","The design of the public pool, hot tub, or water playground and surrounding deck and if visitors live together or not will aect how many people can stay at least 6 feet apart from those they don’t live with. CDC recommends operators of public pools, hot tubs, and water playgrounds:comply with local, state, territorial, federal, and tribal regulatory agency policies and requirements on gathering (so
the number of swimmers in the water isn’t more than the maximum allowed) and
teach and reinforce social (physical) distancing among visitors and sta.
Operators might want to limit the number of people in and around the water so if the water needs to be evacuated
(because of lightning or other health or safety threat) social distancing can be maintained on the deck. Otherwise, if the
water is evacuated and social distancing cannot be maintained on the deck, close the deck to visitors. There is no
standard formula to determine how many people can maintain social distancing in the water and on the surrounding
deck.
"
355,"Can I use pool, hot tub, or water playground water to disinfect surfaces or shared objects","No. Only List N disinfectants approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should be used to disinfect surfaces (such as handrails and in bathrooms) and shared objects (such as kickboards and pool noodles). The list includes hundreds of disinfectants. Operators of public pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) should consult with the design company or engineer to determine which disinfectants are best suited for surfaces and with manufacturers to determine which disinfectants are best suited for shared objects. Remember to clean surfaces and shared objects before disinfecting them and to follow directions on labels of cleaning products and disinfectants."
356,Can the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) light disinfect surfaces and shared objects,"We don’t know yet. Early scientic data suggest that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can be inactivated by the sun’s UV light. However, the ability of the sun’s UV light to inactivate the virus on surfaces (such as handrails and in bathrooms) and shared objects (such as kickboards and pool noodles) needs more research. Factors — such as cloudiness, latitude (distance from equator), time of day, and amount of time exposed to the sun’s UV light — will determine how eectively the virus is inactivated. Remember to clean surfaces and shared objects before disinfecting them and to follow directions on labels of cleaning products and disinfectants ."
357,"How often do surfaces (such as handrails and in bathrooms) at public pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) need to be cleaned and disinfected","The more frequently a surface is touched by multiple people, the more frequently it should be cleaned and then disinfected with a List N disinfectant approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . Frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected at least daily. Remember to clean surfaces and shared objects before disinfecting them and to follow directions on labels of cleaning products and disinfectants."
358,"Do procedures for responding to formed fecal (poop) or diarrheal incidents in public pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) need to change during the COVID-19 pandemic","No. RNA of the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in feces (poop). While data are limited, there is little evidence of infectious virus in feces. Plus, CDC is not aware of any scientic reports of the virus being spread by swallowing or coming in contact with water contaminated by feces from an infected person. As a result, CDC has not changed its fecal incident response recommendations. Remember, do NOT vacuum feces out of the water."
359,"Can lifeguards monitor how visitors socially distance (stay at least 6 feet apart from people you don’t live with), wear cloth masks, or wash hands","Not when lifeguards are actively lifeguarding. Lifeguards actively lifeguarding should not be doing other tasks that could distract them. Drowning deaths have resulted, at least in part, from lifeguards being distracted."
360,How can the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 be slowed during lifeguard training,"Lifeguard trainers can consider the following steps to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19: Have the virus? Stay home to save lives. Educate instructors, lifeguard students, and others about when they should stay home to isolate (if they have symptoms of COVID-19 or tested positive for COVID-19) or quarantine (if they have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19) and when they can return or reschedule training. Conduct daily health checks (see frequently asked question on screening) or ask instructors, students, and others to conduct self-checks (such as temperature screening or symptom checking), if possible. Conduct health checks safely and respectfully and in accordance with any applicable local, state, territorial, federal, and tribal privacy and condentiality laws, rules, and regulations. Be smart, stay at least 6 feet apart Conduct knowledge training virtually or online, when possible, to limit contact among instructors, students, and others. Teach and reinforce social (physical) distancing during in-person skills training in and out of the water — maintaining at least 6 feet between people who don’t live together. Provide physical cues or guides (such as lane lines in the water or chairs and tables on the deck) and visual cues (such as posted signs or tape on the deck). Limit close contact, particularly face-to-face interactions, between people who don’t live together, as recommended by the lifeguarding-certifying organization. Such as Aquatic rescue For practice rescues Have each student practice rescues on his or her household member instead of another student. For actual rescues Stress the need to keep the number of people involved in rescue and resuscitation to the minimum number needed to provide proper care. Stress the need to 1) perform rescues from the deck (using an extending or throwing device) if conditions allow and 2) if possible, have people on the deck wear cloth masks, when removing victim from the water because social distancing cannot be maintained. If an in-water rescue is needed, minimize exposure to the distressed swimmer’s face without protection, if possible approaching him or her from behind. Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) For practice resuscitation Limit student-to-manikin ratio and student-to-automated external debrillator (AED) training device ratio to 1:1. Have each student use his or her own breathing barrier when doing rescue breathing on a manikin. For actual resuscitation Stress the need for and train with personal protective equipment (PPE) during resuscitation, as recommended by the CPR-certifying organization (such as the American Red Cross ), and use a bag-valve mask (BVM) with a high-eciency particulate air (HEPA) lter. BVM ventilation is best delivered with two rescuers. Wear a mask. Save lives. Teach and reinforce use of cloth masks in public settings when around people you don’t live with, particularly when it is dicult to maintain social distancing. Advise people wearing masks to not wear them in the water. Cloth masks can be dicult to breathe through when they’re wet. This means it is particularly important to maintain social distancing in the water. Plus, wet cloth masks don’t slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 as well as dry cloth masks. Cover coughs and sneezes Teach and reinforce covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue (or use the inside of elbow), throw used tissues in the trash, and wash hands. Wash hands often
Teach and reinforce handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after being in a public
place or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if soap and water are not readily available.
Clean and then disinfect
Clean and then disinfect surfaces frequently touched by multiple people (such as door handles, light switches,
and tables). Use cleaning product and a List N disinfectant approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
 as per label instructions.
Clean and then disinfect all shared equipment that is not disposable (such as manikins and rescue tubes)
between users. Use cleaning product and a List N disinfectant approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency  as per label instructions. Consult with manufacturers to decide which List N disinfectants are best for
equipment.
"
362,What is coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. CDC has information on COVID-19 symptoms (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) and caring for yourself and others. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans."
363,What is the FDA doing to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic,"The FDA, along with other federal, state, and local agencies and public health officials across the country and internationally, plays a critical role in protecting public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. FDA staff are working around the clock to support development of medical countermeasures and are providing regulatory advice, guidance, and technical assistance to advance the development and availability of vaccines, therapies, diagnostic tests and other medical devices for use diagnosing, treating, and preventing this novel virus. The FDA continues to monitor the human and animal food supply and take swift action on fraudulent COVID-19 products."
364,What is an emergency use authorization and how is it being used to respond to COVID19,"In certain types of emergencies, the FDA can issue an emergency use authorization, or EUA, to provide more timely access to critical medical products that may help during the emergency when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternative options. The EUA process is different than full FDA approval, clearance, or licensing because the EUA standard requires significantly less data than otherwise would be required for approval, clearance, or licensing by the FDA. This enables the FDA to authorize the emergency use of medical products that meet the criteria for issuance within weeks rather than months to years. Under the EUA authority, the FDA evaluates requests for authorization very quickly using the evidence that is available, carefully balancing the risks and benefits of the product as we know them, in addition to evaluating other criteria. EUAs are in effect until the emergency declaration ends but can be revised or revoked as we evaluate the needs during the emergency, or as products meet the criteria to become approved, cleared, or licensed by the FDA. The What is an EUA? video (https://youtu.be/iGkwaESsGBQ)  (http://www.fda.gov/about-fda/websitepolicies/website-disclaimer) provides a short summary of this information. On February 4, 2020, the HHS Secretary determined that there is a public health emergency involving COVID-19, and subsequently issued declarations justifying the use of EUAs for medical products to prevent, treat and diagnose COVID-19. To date, over 100 EUAs have been issued to allow emergency access to tests, medical devices, personal protective equipment and therapeutics. See the EUAs that have been issued for COVID19 (/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policyframework/emergency-use-authorization#covid19euas)."
365,How does COVID-19 spread,COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person. Some people without symptoms may be able to spread the virus. We are still learning about how the virus spreads and the severity of illness it causes.
366,How can I prevent COVID-19,"The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus. CDC recommends everyday preventive actions (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019- ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases. CDC recommends washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not available, CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol."
367,Should I wear a face covering or mask when I go out in public,"CDC recommends wearing masks in public when other social distancing
measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in
areas of significant community-based transmission of the coronavirus. The purpose of
wearing a mask in public is to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may
have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.
The FDA does not regulate masks or cloth face coverings worn by the general public. The FDA does regulate medical devices, including personal protective equipment (PPE) such as surgical masks and N95 respirators. PPE should be reserved for use by health care workers, first responders, and other frontline workers whose jobs put them at much greater risk of acquiring COVID-19."
368,What treatments are available for COVID-19,"Currently there are no FDA-approved medicines specifically for COVID-19. However, the FDA has granted emergency use authorizations for some medicines to be used for certain patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The National Institutes of Health provides more information about treatment options.People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People
with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency
such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19.
Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor
for your health condition."
369,"Can I prevent or treat COVID-19 by using disinfectant sprays, wipes, or liquids on my skin? Can I inject, inhale, or ingest (swallow) disinfectants to prevent or treat COVID-19","No. Disinfectant products such as sprays, mists, wipes, or liquids are only to be used on hard, non-porous surfaces (materials that do not absorb liquids easily) such as floors and countertops, or on soft surfaces such as mattresses, sofas, and beds.Disinfectants should not be used on human or animal skin. Disinfectants may
cause serious skin and eye irritation.
Disinfectants are dangerous for people to inject, inhale, or ingest. If you breathe, inject,
or swallow disinfectants you may be seriously hurt or die. If someone near you swallows,
injects, or breathes a disinfectant, call poison control or a medical professional
immediately.
"
370,Does spraying people with disinfectant lower the spread of COVID-19,"Currently there are no data showing that spraying people with aerosolized disinfectants, or having people walk through tunnels or rooms where disinfectant is in the air, can treat, prevent, or lower the spread of COVID-19. Surface disinfectants should not be used on people or animals. Disinfectant products, such as sprays, mists, wipes, or liquids are only to be used on hard, non-porous surfaces (materials that do not absorb liquids easily) such as floors and countertops, or on soft surfaces such as mattresses, sofas, and beds. CDC provides information regarding disinfectant practices for surfaces in the Reopening Guidance for Cleaning and Disinfecting Public Spaces, Workplaces, Businesses, Schools, and Homes . Human antiseptic drugs, such as hand sanitizers, are intended for use on human skin, but are not intended for aerosolization (to be sprayed in the air in very small droplets). Due to serious safety concerns, including the risk of inhalational toxicity and flammability, the FDA’s temporary policies for alcohol-based hand sanitizers during the COVID-19 public
health emergency specifically do not apply to aerosol sprays. In addition, hand
sanitizers are intended for use on the hands, and should never be used over larger body
surfaces, swallowed, or inhaled.
"
371,Will Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS) cure COVID-19,"No. Miracle Mineral Solution does not cure COVID-19 and has not been approved by the FDA for any use. The solution, when mixed as directed, forms industrial bleach that may cause serious and potentially life-threatening side effects. FDA took action  against Genesis II Church of Health and Healing for unlawfully distributing Miracle Mineral Solution for the treatment of COVID-19 and other diseases."
372,Is hand sanitizer effective against COVID-19,"The best way to prevent the spread of infections and decrease the risk of getting sick is by washing your hands with plain soap and water, advises the CDC . Washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is essential, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing one’s nose. If soap and water are not available, CDC recommends consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol."
373,"Where can I buy hand sanitizer? If I can’t find it in the store, can I make my own","Many retail stores and pharmacies sell hand sanitizers. However, we understand that many stores have run out of hand sanitizers and they may be difficult to find. To help increase the availability of hand sanitizers, the FDA has issued guidance (/regulatoryinformation/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-temporary-policypreparation-certain-alcohol-based-hand-sanitizer-products-during) for the temporary preparation of alcohol-based hand sanitizers by some companies and pharmacies during the COVID-19 public health emergency. The FDA does not recommend that consumers make their own hand sanitizer. If made incorrectly, hand sanitizer can be ineffective, and there have been reports of skin burns from homemade hand sanitizer. The agency lacks verifiable information on the methods being used to prepare hand sanitizer at home and whether they are safe for use on
human skin.
"
376,What are the symptoms of COVID-19,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention."
377,How do I know if it is COVID-19 or just the common flu,"A COVID-19 infection has the same signs and symptoms as the common cold and you can only differentiate them through laboratory testing to determine the virus type. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, you should seek medical attention and immediately isolate yourself from others. Call your local UN clinic/medical facility to inform them of your condition and relevant travel/exposure history. If you had been identified as a close contact of a case by the local Ministry of Health or WHO, please also indicate this. From here you will be advised if a medical assessment is necessary and how to get tested."
378,Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air,Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.
379,What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease,"Protection measures for everyone Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple
precautions:
• Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them
with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based
hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
• Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or
sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes, they spray small liquid droplets from
their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the
droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
• Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up
viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From
there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
• Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means
covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze.
Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following
good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu
and COVID-19.
• Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek
medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the
situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly
direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of
viruses and other infections.
• Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is
spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older
person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching
COVID-19 in one of these areas.
"
380,I am well and asymptomatic. Should I use a mask,"According to the WHO, for individuals without respiratory symptoms, a medical mask is not required, as no evidence is available on its usefulness to protect non-sick persons. However, masks might be worn in some countries according to local cultural habits. If masks are used, best practices should be followed on how to wear, remove, and dispose of them and on hand hygiene action after removal. For more information, visit the WHO guidance on use of masks in the community."
381,How likely am I to catch COVID-19,"The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19. COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide."
382,Are pregnant women more susceptible to the COVID-19 virus and will it harm the fetus,"We do not have information from published scientific reports about the susceptibility of pregnant women to COVID-19. Pregnant women experience immunologic and physiologic changes, which might make them more susceptible to viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly by close contact with an infected person through respiratory droplets. Whether a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can transmit the virus that causes COVID-19 to her fetus or neonate by other routes of vertical transmission (before, during, or after delivery) is still unknown."
384,Are the symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than in adults,"No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. It’s not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs. There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children."
385,Should I worry about COVID-19,"Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones. We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost, among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings."
386,Who is at risk of developing severe illness,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others."
387,Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others."
388,re there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19,"A While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines.  "
389,"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19","Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19. The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing."
390,Should I wear a mask to protect myself from catching the COVID-19 virus,"Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely. WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks (see Advice on the use of masks). The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing."
391,Until when should I wear a mask after recovering from an illness with respiratory symptoms,"In order to avoid infecting others, you should use a mask for as long as you are still coughing or sneezing. You should only stop after a complete recovery (which means 24-48 hours after having no symptoms without medication)."
392,I am looking after someone who is ill with suspect or confirmed COVID-19. What precautions should I take,"• You should limit the movement around the house of the individual who is ill and minimize shared space. • Ensure shared spaces like bathrooms, and the kitchen are well ventilated. One way to do this is by keeping the windows open. Clean and disinfect the bathroom and toilet surface at least once a day using regular household soap or detergent for cleaning and then disinfecting with a regular household disinfectant containing 0.5% sodium hypochlorite. • Do not forget the importance of hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand-rub or soap and water (if hands are visibly soiled). • Whenever possible, household members should stay in a different room or maintain a distance of at least 1 meter from the ill person. • When helping care for the sick individual, wear a tightly fitted medical/surgical mask that covers your nose and mouth when in the same room as the affected individual. Make sure you are careful not to touch your mask. If your mask gets wet or dirty, it should be replaced. When removing a mask, it is important to throw it away and perform hand hygiene. Dispose of any material with respiratory secretions immediately after use. • Both the ill individual and you, as the caregiver, should perform hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions."
393,How long is the incubation and transmission period for COVID-19,"The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1- 14 days, most commonly around five days."
394,Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source,"Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed. To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products."
395,How long does the virus survive on surfaces,"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment). If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose."
396,How can I get tested for COVID-19,"If you are well, no testing is recommended. If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, you should immediately isolate yourself from others. Call your local UN clinic/medical facility to inform them of your condition and relevant travel/exposure history. If you had been identified as a close contact of a case by the local Ministry of Health or WHO, please also indicate this. From here you will be advised if a medical assessment is necessary and how to get tested."
397,What alternatives do I have if there are no hand sanitizers available? Can I use other alcohol like ethyl or liquor,"If hand sanitizers are not available, hand washing with soap and water is the recommended, and even better, alternative. Liquor is not effective against coronavirus. For an alcohol-based hand rub to be effective, it must have an alcohol content of 60% to 95%."
398,Can people who recover from COVID-19 be infected again,"We know that for similar coronaviruses, infected people are unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover. However, because the immune response to COVID-19 is not yet understood, it is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients who have recovered from COVID-19."
399,Is it safe to receive a package from an area where COVID-19 has been reported,"Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low."
400,Is there a connection between COVID -19 and environment temperature,"It is not known yet if weather and temperature changes impact or has any connection with COVID-19. At this time, it is not clear or known if the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when the weather becomes warmer."
401,"Can I catch the virus from being in an enclosed space (i.e. bus, subway) in close proximity to someone who doesn’t have respiratory symptoms","Since the virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets, the risk of catching it from somebody who is asymptomatic, even a contact of a confirmed COVID-19 case, is low. However, in light of the pandemic, everyone should maintain social distancing, which means keeping at least 1 meter away from others, avoiding mass gatherings and areas with large numbers of people, and practicing frequent hand washing and hand sanitizing according to the recommendation."
402,. Should I start avoiding people of Asian descent and their businesses,"The virus can affect anyone regardless of nationality, race and color. The Organization will not tolerate discrimination and encourages everyone to promote culturally appropriate and empathetic community engagement and to detect and rapidly respond to negative public perceptions and counter misinformation."
403,"When should we identify ourselves as ""being sick"" and stay at home","Although a fever is a sure sign that you are sick enough not to come to work, anyone experiencing respiratory symptoms like coughing and sneezing should stay at home."
404,My colleague is sick but he/she insists that it is just the common cold and is reluctant to work from home. What steps can we take to enforce “staying at home when not well” amongst staff,"While it is very likely that your colleague is only suffering from the common cold or flu, all precautions should, nevertheless, be taken. Managers should encourage staff members with flu symptoms to telecommute for some time until the symptoms have abated. Alternatively, if the staff member is feeling unfit, he/she should take sick leave. This is a sensible approach at any time to prevent the spreading of flu or other seasonal viruses. Supervisors are also encouraged to exercise flexibility in terms of using remote working arrangements if the staff member would like to limit their contact with others and work from home."
405,What can we do if we don’t have any hand sanitizers in the office building,"You should contact the Facilities Management Service of your local UN duty station, organization or the building administration."
406,What is the process for evaluating the criticality of official travels and meetings,UN Medical Directors recommend that UN managers and/or UN personnel undertake a risk assessment to evaluate the criticality of the proposed travel balanced against the risks to the traveler for any travel to or meetings in affected areas experiencing ongoing transmission of COVID-19.
407,UN Medical Directors recommend that UN managers and/or UN personnel undertake a risk assessment to evaluate the criticality of the proposed travel balanced against the risks to the traveler for any travel to or meetings in affected areas experiencing ongoing transmission of COVID-19,"For meetings during the COVID-19 outbreak, the Division of Healthcare Management and Occupational Safety and Health (DHMOSH) has prepared the following guidelines for meeting organizers and participants which are available in the UN HR portal. UN offices should use these global guidelines to develop local ones in accordance with host country legislation. • The WHO has also released an interim guidance with key planning recommendations for mass gatherings in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak."
408,I plan to travel to / have a meeting in countries or territories currently experiencing local transmission of COVID-19. Should I cancel this travel/meeting,"While the WHO does not recommend and advises against the application of any travel restrictions based on the information currently available on COVID-19, as an occupational health measure, it is recommended that for all official travel, UN managers and/or UN personnel undertake a risk assessment to evaluate the criticality of the proposed travel balanced against the risks to the traveler for any travel to or meetings in affected areas experiencing ongoing transmission of COVID-19. This includes risks posed by both medical issues and evolving travel/border restrictions enacted by states parties. • Please be aware that local authorities may begin to implement travel restrictions and health screening measures for travelers entering or exiting the country. All UN personnel who are planning to travel should check with the destination countries’ embassy, consulate, or Ministry of Health and keep up to date with local health advice before and during your travel. You should also comply with any screening measures put in place by local authorities. • As the outbreak evolves, it can be difficult to predict the situation globally, and it would be prudent to make contingency arrangements should the need arise. Feel free to consult us further at dos-dhmosh-public-health@un.org as needed."
409,"What is the protocol for staff members returning to work after visiting COVID-19 affected countries (i.e., those with ongoing transmission)","If you have just returned from an affected area, you should self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days after travel. • During that period, you should immediately seek medical attention should you develop any signs and symptoms, such as shortness of breath or cough. • Remember to share your previous travel history with your health care provider and make every effort to inform them by phone prior to visiting a medical facility and wear a medical mask when you seek medical care. • You should only return to work when you are well and completely free of symptoms. • HR personnel and managers are encouraged to exercise flexibility around remote working to support staff."
410,I just returned from travel to a country/area experiencing local transmission of COVID-19. I am well and have no symptoms. Can I go back to the workplace,"For any UN personnel who are free of symptoms, and returning from country/area or territory experiencing local transmission of COVID-19, managers are encouraged to exercise flexibility in terms of using remote working arrangements for staff in these situations who would like to limit their contact with others and work from home for 14 days post-travel. This is not mandatory but is strongly encouraged. • Individuals returning from areas of outbreaks should be advised to review our health advisory on this Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) page so that you have awareness about the disease. You should monitor yourself daily for signs of fever, respiratory symptoms (e.g., breathing difficulties, cough), and know where to seek medical attention if you are aware of any symptoms within yourself. You should monitor yourself for at least 14 days after your travel."
411,What about self-quarantining after returning from an area/country of high prevalence,"If you have just returned from an affected area, you should self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days after travel. During that period, you should immediately seek medical attention should you develop any signs and symptoms, such as shortness of breath or cough. • Self-quarantine for 14 days is recommended when you have been exposed to contact with lab-confirmed COVID-19. • Since this is a rapidly evolving situation, many member states are imposing quarantine recommendations for travelers, which varies by country. We suggest monitoring the travel advisories issued from WHO and DHMOSH for up to date information"
412,Have medical insurance related questions,Please refer to Frequently Asked Questions for UN staff on Medical Insurance in connection with the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak
413,What are the latest protocols and guidance for Medical Evacuation of staff members with severe respiratory infections related to COVID-19,"For the latest information on normal Medevac procedure for staff, go to: https://hr.un.org/sites/hr.un.org/files/Coronavirus_MedevacGuidance_UN_RC_0.pdf • For information on special Medevac procedure organized by the WHO in cases where there are no ICU beds available in your country, see: https://hr.un.org/sites/hr.un.org/files/COVIDMEDEVAC%20UN%20and%20PARTNERS.pdf"
414,Should I get a face mask,"Yes, you should wear a mask whenever you are in a public place where you will encounter other people. The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can spread between people interacting in close proximity — for example, speaking, coughing, sneezing, or singing— even if those people do not symptoms. Learn more information about how masks help prevent the spread of COVID-19."
415,Can I make my own hand sanitizer,There are no studies supporting the effectiveness of homemade hand sanitizer blend in killing the new coronavirus on people’s hands. Experts agree that the best method for cleaning hands is washing for at least 20 seconds with soap and water.
416,Can coronavirus live on objects? Mail from affected areas? Clothes,"There is no evidence at present that items imported from affected areas and shipped or mailed over the course of days or weeks are spreading COVID-19. Although the new coronavirus weakens and dies over time outside of the human body, studies suggest that it can live on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days, depending on surface, temperature and other environmental factors. For instance, a small amount of the new coronavirus is still detectable on plastic surfaces for up to three days, on stainless steel for up to two days and up to one day on cardboard, but it’s at less than 0.1% of the starting virus material.

So far, evidence suggests that the virus does not survive as well on a soft surface (such as fabric) as it does on frequently touched hard surfaces like elevator buttons and door handles.

More research will provide information on the coronavirus and how long it lives on surfaces. In the meantime, wash your hands thoroughly after handling mail, and carefully dispose of all outer packaging."
417,Is it safe to order take-out,"According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there have not been any cases of COVID-19 known to be caused from eating food or handling food packaging."
418,Is grocery shopping safe during the coronavirus pandemic,"It’s best not to make unnecessary trips, but if you need to go to a grocery store, it’s important to maintain social and physical distancing as you shop, and to clean your hands often while shopping and as soon as you get home."
419,Should I stop going to the gym,"As the new coronavirus is spreading, be cautious about all possible exposures, including at the gym or fitness center. The virus isn’t spread through perspiration (sweat), but items touched by many people (barbells, etc.) could pose a risk. In order to practice social and physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is best to avoid public places at this time."
420,Should I cancel my trip,"At this time, social and physical distancing are important to follow, so overall, travel is discouraged. Outbreaks of the new coronavirus and COVID-19, the disease it causes, are occurring in the United States and in countries around the world. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated travel information on a range of destinations.

Travelers should be cautious about cruise ship travel and situations that involve crowded places. You are less likely to catch the new coronavirus on airplanes because of circulation and filtering, but you may be asked about your infection risk when you book a flight. And be aware that you may be prevented from returning from certain sites should they be on lockdown."
421,Can humans get coronavirus from dogs or cats,"there is little evidence at this time that such animals are easily infected with the virus under normal conditions, or could transmit it. The World Organisation for Animal Health in Paris, and in the U.S., the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are closely monitoring the situation but do not recommend routine testing of animals. The cases of the tigers in the Bronx Zoo and, more recently, of the two pet cats in New York, should not be cause for public alarm but a reminder that the COVID-19 crisis is actively evolving and that we have yet to learn more about the virus and its effects on both human and animal health."
422,Knowing the Symptoms,"COVID-19 symptoms include:

Cough
Fever or chills
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Muscle or body aches
Sore throat
New loss of taste or smell
Diarrhea
Headache
New fatigue
Nausea or vomiting
Congestion or runny nose"
423,Is the coronavirus worse than the flu? Why are there travel restrictions and canceled events,"At present, there is no vaccine for this new coronavirus as there is for many forms of the flu. No one has immunity from the new coronavirus, because it’s new to human beings. The new coronavirus is contagious, and can cause severe disease, even death."
424,What is coronavirus fatality rate,"Right now, it appears that COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, causes more cases of severe disease and more deaths than the seasonal flu. People over age 85 have the highest risk of fatality and children under 19, the lowest, but this could change as more people are tested and trends become clearer. If, over time, widespread testing reveals more mild, non-fatal cases of COVID-19, the death rate will go down."
425,Can coronavirus live in heat? Will the outbreak stop when it gets warm outside,"Several countries currently affected by the new coronavirus outbreak are experiencing summer weather. Some viral illnesses, like the flu, seem to be less common in warmer months, but it is still possible to catch them during that time. Investigations are exploring the effects of temperature and weather on the spread of this new coronavirus."
426,Why is it called a “coronavirus?”,"Corona means “crown,” and coronaviruses have a “crown” of protruding points on their surface that give them a characteristic appearance when seen under a microscope. Coronaviruses are a whole family of viruses; there are many."
427,What’s the difference between the new coronavirus and other coronaviruses,"There are many different kinds of coronavirus. Some only affect animals. Some have been circulating among human beings for years, causing mild colds. Others have caused small, severe human disease outbreaks in the past, such as the coronaviruses that caused SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012. The new coronavirus is different from these, and was only identified in December 2019."
428,Is the coronavirus spread by the airborne route,"Possibly. In addition to spreading by respiratory droplets, smaller particles containing the coronavirus might linger in the air for longer periods of time. Scientific evidence suggests that small viral particles may remain aloft in the air for several hours under experimental conditions. People often catch COVID-19 after being indoors, close to infected people who may or may not have symptoms. All of this suggests that there may be an airborne component to the transmission of this virus.

The possibility of the coronavirus being contagious through the air is why it is so important to wear masks at all times, except when you are at home with your family. Masks prevent respiratory droplets from spreading, not only when you cough and sneeze, but also when you are talking, singing or exercising."
429,What is COVID-19,"COVID-19, otherwise known as coronavirus disease 2019, is a new illness that affects your lungs and airways. It is particularly severe in older populations and people with underlying health conditions."
430,Are coronavirus and COVID-19 the same,"The two terms are often used interchangeably, but COVID-19 is the name of the disease caused by a previously unknown virus called SARS-CoV-2. The virus is part of a family of coronaviruses that cause different illnesses, including the common cold and the flu."
431,When did COVID-19 start,"The virus was discovered in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since spread around the world. It was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020."
432,What are the common symptoms,"Not everyone who has COVID-19 will have symptoms, and some people may not even know they have the virus. You can still pass COVID-19 on even if you have no symptoms, so it’s important to follow advice to stop the virus from spreading.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are a dry and continuous cough, fever and tiredness. Other flu-like symptoms such as a sore throat, aches and pains, headache or runny nose are also common. These symptoms can be managed at home and you will usually get better within a week.

Some people will become more seriously ill with COVID-19 and experience difficulty breathing or pneumonia. In these cases, it’s important to seek medical care. In severe cases, COVID-19 can lead to death."
433,When do symptoms start to appear,"It can take up to 14 days for people to show symptoms, but most people notice them in the first four to five days."
434,What should I do if I think I have COVID-19,"If you think you have COVID-19, stay at home and call your local health service for advice. Do not visit your clinic as you could pass the virus onto others.

The people you live with should also stay home for at least 14 days from when you first noticed symptoms.

Avoid close contact with others in your household while you’re ill. If you live with someone who’s more vulnerable, try to arrange for them to stay elsewhere.

Do not invite other people to come to your home to help look after you, as you will be putting them at risk of getting the virus."
435,Does COVID-19 need treatment,"Around 80% of people who get COVID-19 will recover without needing special treatment at home, and usually within around seven days. Most people will only have mild symptoms similar to the common cold.

Around one in six people will become severely ill and develop difficulty breathing, in which case they will need hospital care. In serious cases COVID-19 can cause pneumonia."
436,Who is more vulnerable to COVID-19,"The likelihood of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 is higher for older people and those with severe underlying health issues, including high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes.

People with a weakened immune system – for example if they are having chemotherapy treatment for cancer, or have a low CD4 count as a result of HIV – are also at a higher risk of serious illness."
437,Can COVID-19 be cured,"There’s no proven cure for COVID-19, but most people will recover fully without needing medical treatment.

If you’re unwell with COVID-19, resting, drinking lots of liquids, and taking paracetamol or other home remedies can help with symptoms.

If your symptoms don’t improve after seven days or if you have difficulty breathing and persistent pain in your chest, call your local health service immediately."
438,Are anti-HIV and anti-malaria drugs effective against COVID-19,"As yet, there is no strong evidence that antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV can be used to treat COVID-19. Several studies have shown promising results, however, the certainty of the evidence is very low due to limitations in the studies.

Clinical trials are also underway with two anti-malaria drugs – chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Currently, there is not enough data to assess how effective either of these medicines are in treating COVID-19, or preventing people from getting it.

Remember, taking any of these drugs without medical supervision is potentially very dangerous."
439,I am already taking anti-malarial or anti-HIV drugs – can I get COVID-19,There is no evidence that people already taking anti-malarial or anti-HIV drugs will have any level of immunity to COVID-19. It’s best to continue to take any medication you have already been prescribed and to follow the advice to prevent COVID-19.
440,How is COVID-19 passed on,"COVID-19 is spread through contact with respiratory droplets (droplets of saliva or mucus from the nose or mouth) from someone who has the virus. This mainly occurs when:

someone with the virus coughs or breathes and these droplets land on nearby surfaces and objects. The virus is then spread when another person comes into contact with the droplets and touches their own face, particularly eyes, nose or mouth

an infected person sneezes, coughs or breathes, and people around them breathe in these droplets."
441,Can COVID-19 be passed on through sex,"There is no evidence that COVID-19 can be passed on through sexual fluids (semen, vaginal fluid, blood and anal mucus).

However, the virus is easily spread by coming into close contact with others, and through saliva when kissing. Some initial evidence has found COVID-19 can be spread through poop (faeces), so rimming (oral-anal sex) might increase your risk of getting the virus.

If you or your partner is unwell with COVID-19, it’s best to avoid having any sexual contact – including kissing and cuddling."
442,Can COVID-19 be passed from mother-to-child,"With so few cases, it is unclear whether COVID-19 can be passed from a woman to her unborn or newborn baby.

Emerging evidence suggests that it may be possible for mothers to pass on COVID-19 to their babies through pregnancy or birth.1 However, this is still being investigated.

Pregnant women should continue to follow advice to protect themselves from the virus, and seek medical care straight away if they have symptoms.

There is currently no evidence that COVID-19 can be passed on through breastfeeding.2"
443,Can COVID-19 be transmitted through food,"There is no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 can be passed on through food.

However, as with all types of infection, practising food safety will help to reduce any risk. You can do this by:

making sure animal products are cooked properly
washing your hands throughout the preparation of food
cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and utensils after cooking."
444,How can I stop the spread of COVID-19,"The main ways you can stop the virus spreading are:

wash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 40 seconds. If you don’t have access to clean water and soap, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer and keep rubbing it into your hands for 20 seconds
avoid touching your face
sneeze or cough into a clean tissue, and then throw it away and wash your hands. If you don’t have a tissue, use the inside of your elbow to cover your mouth
stay at least one metre away from other people, especially if they are unwell."
445,What is social/physical distancing,"People are advised to keep their distance from others to prevent COVID-19 from spreading.

Social distancing works by reducing the number of people you meet in a day, which slows the spread of the virus. This will help to stop the health system from becoming overwhelmed with large numbers of patients needing care at the same time.
The exact advice on how to do this will vary depending where you live."
446,Should I wear a fabric (cloth) mask,"The World Health Organisation now recommends using face masks when you are not able to stay at least 1 meter away from others. This includes when you’re on public transport, inside shops, or any other time when you’re in a confined or crowded space. This advice applies primarily to places where COVID-19 is still being actively passed on in the community.

This is because we now have evidence that some people who get COVID-19 don’t get any symptoms but can still pass the virus on. Wearing fabric masks prevent these asymptomatic and seemingly healthy people from passing on the virus in public spaces. If you do have symptoms for COVID-19, you still need to stay home and self-isolate - wearing a mask is not enough. Fabric masks do not prevent the wearer from getting COVID-19.

Medical masks are in short supply globally. These should be prioritised for health workers, people with COVID-19 symptoms and those caring for them; and at-risk groups in situations when they can't guarantee a distance of one meter from others. "
447,Are people living with HIV more at risk,"There is currently no evidence that people living with HIV are at a higher risk of being infected with coronavirus, the virus that causes COVID-19 illness. Our understanding of the risk of developing severe COVID-19 in people living with HIV is evolving. Current evidence suggests that HIV is less of a risk factor for severe COVID-19 than other health conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer, diabetes, or being over a certain age.

People living with HIV who have a compromised immune system may be at greater risk and should take extra steps to prevent infection. This includes people with a low CD4 count (<200 copies/cell), a high viral load or a recent opportunistic infection.

The best way to stay healthy is by taking your antiretroviral treatment."
448,How can people living with HIV prepare for COVID-19,"People living with HIV should follow the general prevention advice for COVID-19. It’s also important to:

continue taking your antiretroviral treatment (ART) as prescribed to keep your immune system healthy
stock up on ART so you have at least a 30-day supply, ideally three months if possible
make sure your immunisations/vaccinations are up to date (such as flu and pneumonia vaccines)
have a plan in place for staying at home, including how you will get hold of food and medicine and how to contact your healthcare facility if necessary
take care of yourself by eating well, exercising as best you can (even at home), and looking after your mental health."
449,How COVID-19 Spreads,"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets coming from the nose or mouth when a person with COVID-19 coughs or breathes out. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, and then their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breath in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or breathes out droplets. This is why it is important to stay 3-6 feet or about 1-2 meters away from a person who is sick."
450,"Symptoms, Testing and Treatment","The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Other symptoms include repeated shaking with chills, muscle pains, headache, sore throat and new loss of taste or smell.

Those who are ill may also have fatigue (tiredness), nasal congestion (stuffy nose), or diarrhea; however, many people who become infected do not have any symptoms. Most people who get COVID-19 get better without needing special treatment. However, some become very ill. Please talk to your doctor about any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you."
451,Are the symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than adults,"No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally shown mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. It’s not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs. There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children."
452,Who needs to be tested for COVID-19,"The guidelines for COVID-19 testing vary by location, so check with your local health department or Ministry of Health. In general, only those who have symptoms or are at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19 need to be tested. If you are having symptoms and feel you need to be tested, if at all possible, reach out to a medical provider by phone before seeking care in person."
453,What should I do if I think I am sick,"If you think you have been exposed to COVID-19 and develop a fever and symptoms, such as cough or difficulty breathing, call your healthcare provider for medical advice. If you are sick, you should stay home and stay away from others as much as possible. Many people will be able to recover at home; however, be sure to get care if you think it is an emergency. If you seek care, call ahead to make sure they know you may have COVID-19 so that healthcare workers can protect themselves."
455,Can anti-malarial drugs be used to treat or prevent COVID-19,"The World Health Organization (WHO) is keeping up with research that is being done in hospitals and labs in response to COVID-19, including studies that look at anti-malarial drugs (chloroquine and its derivative, hydroxy-chloroquine) for treatment and/or prevention. Currently there is not enough evidence to say whether these medicines work for treating patients with COVID-19 or preventing people from getting COVID-19.

The research will show us in the next few weeks how the drugs work in treating COVID-19. Doctors will review the evidence to see if the drugs help. If you have COVID-19, you should consult your doctor about the drugs you should take to manage your symptoms."
456,What steps can my family take to reduce our risk of getting COVID-19,"Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same. These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have chronic medical conditions:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.
Cover your coughs and sneezes with the inside of your elbow or a tissue and throw the tissue in the trash. Then wash your hands.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before cooking or eating.
If you do not have soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that people touch a lot (e.g. phones, other electronics, tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and cabinet handles)."
457,How should I clean and disinfect my home in order to protect myself and my family from COVID-19,"If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water before you disinfect. After cleaning and disinfecting, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.

On a regular basis, clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks."
458,What does it mean to practice ‘social distancing’,"Keeping your distance from others (3-6 feet or 1-2 meters away).
Not taking public transportation, taxis, or ride-shares during this period.
Avoiding crowded places (for example: shopping centers, schools, workplaces, movie theaters, and places of worship such as churches, temples, synagogues, and mosques)."
459,Should I use a facemask or face cover to prevent COVID-19,"We realize that there have been some changes on this topic. Why this change? There has been a growing realization that one way that the virus is spreading is through people who have COVID-19 but do not yet show any symptoms.  Therefore the current recommendation is that you should cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when you are out in public, for example while going to the grocery store. This is to protect others from the risk of getting COVID-19, since you could spread the virus to others even if you do not feel sick.

The face cover should cover the mouth and nose completely. Face covers must not be shared, and each person should have their own face covers. It is useful to have two sets of such face covers so one can be washed while the other is used.

Cloth face covers should not be used by people who have trouble breathing, or children under age 2 years, or people who are unable to remove the mask without help.

The cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing. You should continue to keep 6 feet between yourself and others. Hand washing is still very important, and hands should be washed before wearing the face cover.

A medical/ surgical face mask should ONLY be used by people who have COVID-19 and are showing symptoms or by healthcare workers."
460,What resources are available to me if I am struggling with issues related to sexual or domestic violence during this time,Help and support are available to you. Many services for people struggling with issues related to sexual and domestic violence are available remotely during this COVID-19 public health emergency. 
461,Who is at risk for serious complications from COVID-19,"People of all ages can become infected with COVID-19, but some people are at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness. This includes:

Older adults
People who have underlying chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, lung disease
This does not, however, mean that other groups won’t fall sick or are immune from it. Everyone is at risk; some more than others."
462,Are people with disabilities at higher risk for COVID-19 infection or severe illness,"Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.  Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.

You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed."
463,What is corona virus,"Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. "
468,Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms,"The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. "
469,Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease,"The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. The ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating. 
"
470,Protection measures for everyone,"Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the national,state and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news. You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID19 by taking some simple precautions:
• Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcoholbased hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
• Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
• Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
• Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
• Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread
of viruses and other infections.
• Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas."
471,"Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading","Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for everyone)
Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people. Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.
If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers. Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses. "
475,Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19,"No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection. "
476,"Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure
COVID-19","While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. We does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. We will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available."
477,Is there a vaccine drug or treatment for COVID-19,"Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing."
478,Is COVID-19 the same as SARS,"No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different.
SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003. 
"
479,Should I wear mask to protect myself,"Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so We urge people to use masks wisely. We advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. 
"
480,How to put on use take off and dispose of a mask,"1. Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.
2. Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water
3. Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.
4. Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).
5. Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).
6. Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.
7. Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.
8. After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.
9. Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.
10. Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water. 
"
481,How long is the incubation period for COVID-19,"The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available. "
483,Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet,"While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.
We continues to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID19 topics and will update as new findings are available. "
485,"Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has
been reported","Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low. 
"
486,Is there anything I should not do,"The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:
• Smoking
• Wearing multiple masks
• Taking antibiotics (See question 10 ""Are there any medicines of therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?"") In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider. "
487,What are coronaviruses,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which can infect people. Some cause mostly mild illness, such as the strains responsible for some common colds. Others can potentially also lead to severe, or even fatal, disease - such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which continues to circulate in some parts of the world. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak was caused by a coronavirus. It caused severe and fatal disease, however, is no longer in circulation. The natural reservoir for coronaviruses is thought to be animal hosts. New strains emerge from this reservoir, infect an 'intermediate' host, and from there infect people. The viruses may then be capable of being transmitted from one person to another. Some are efficient at human-to-human transmission, while others are not."
488,"What does ""novel"" mean","Novel means new. In this case, the 2019-novel coronavirus was given a new name SARS-CoV-2 as of 12 February, reflecting that the new virus is related to the SARS coronavirus seen in 2002. The virus is a previously-unidentified strain of coronavirus. It is responsible for the outbreak of pneumonia which began in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The disease caused by the virus has been called COVID-19, or Coronavirus Disease-2019."
489,Who is at risk for infection,"The disease can move from person to person, but it is not yet known how easily or sustainably it spreads. Scientists are studying the data as it becomes available. The initial cases reported having visited a seafood/animal market, which may have been a source of exposure. However now the main way the disease is spreading is from person to person. Some people have had a mild illness and recovered. Others have had more severe infections. Critical and fatal cases have occurred. Preliminary evidence indicates that people with underlying medical conditions, elderly people and those with compromised immune systems may be at higher risk for severe illness."
490,Are pregnant women at higher risk for severe disease,"So far there is little information about whether pregnant women are more likely to have a severe infection than other healthy adults. A review of 28 pregnant women in China who were infected with COVID-19 found that they did not have a more severe illness than non-pregnant women, and none of their babies were infected. A systematic review of 9 studies found that women with COVID-19 had no difference in risk for severe illness than that of the general population however, some were less symptomatic. Adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth and low birthweight appeared to be slightly higher. The Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists states ""Generally, pregnant women do not appear to be more likely to be seriously unwell than other healthy adults if they develop coronavirus. It is expected the large majority of pregnant women will experience only mild or moderate cold/flu like symptoms"". The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control states ""No current evidence suggests that infection with COVID-19 during pregnancy has a negative effect on the foetus. At present, there is no evidence of transmission of COVID-19 from mother to baby during pregnancy."" The United States Centers for Disease Prevention and Control state ""pregnant people might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant people. Additionally, there may be an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, among pregnant people with COVID-19”. See their Frequently Asked Questions and Answers: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Pregnancy for more information."
491,Are children getting infected? What is the pediatric inflammatory syndrome,"Early in the outbreak, it seemed as if young children were not getting the disease very commonly and, if they were infected, they might have mild or no symptoms. Studies so far show that people under 18 years old account for 2 percent or fewer of known COVID-19 cases. This could be because, in general, children have shown no symptoms or milder symptoms than adults and so their infections may be going undetected. Symptoms in children can include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported more commonly among children than adults who have COVID-19. In late April, pediatricians in New York began noting an increase in inflammatory/shock type serious illness among children - some of whom had COVID-19. As information was shared more widely, and monitoring increased, other states and countries started reporting similar occurrences among children. This syndrome is still very rare, and has not yet definitively been linked to coronavirus. Follow the Latest News story for updated developments in this emerging field of information."
493,Do people with COVID-19 lose their sense of smell or taste,"Several groups of doctors, particularly those who work in the ears/nose/throat field, have reported that some people who lost their sense of smell or taste and tested positive for the disease even without other symptoms. Though a reduced ability to taste to smell can be common in people with a ‘stuffy nose’ (nasal congestion) attributed with seasonal allergies and other medical conditions, these COVID-19 patients often reported the change in senses without any stuffy nose. The medical groups reporting this information suggested that it might be useful for people who lose their sense of taste or smell to self-isolate for at least 7 days to prevent spreading the virus – which they can do even if they have no other symptoms. They also suggested these symptoms might be added to COVID-19 screening tools used by clinicians to determine who should be tested and advised to self-isolate. The World Health Organization is investigating the situation and has not yet made a formal declaration on any changes to protocol based on these symptoms."
494,What does cough etiquette mean,"Cough etiquette, or respiratory hygiene, is a measure taken to reduce person-to-person transmission of infected droplets. Individuals should distance themselves, cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and sneezing. It is important that tissues are disposed of correctly (in nearest waste bin) after use and that hands are washed immediately with soap and water or alcohol based hand sanitizer (containing 60-85% alcohol)."
495,Is there a vaccine,No. It may take months or years for a vaccine to be developed. Research and testing is underway.
497,Can a person have no symptoms but spread the infection,"People who are infected can spread the disease for about two days before they have developed symptoms. People are probably most infectious at the time symptoms first start, even if these symptoms are only mild. Therefore it is very important for contacts of COVID-19 cases to quarantine themselves at home, and minimise contact with others for 14 days after exposure even if they do not have any symptoms."
498,Can I get re-infected with COVID-19,"The data around re-infected cases is emerging. It is likely that persons who have recovered from COVID-19 are immune, and cannot be re-infected, for some period of time. It is not known if this protective immunity lasts for months or years. It is also likely that those testing positive for antibodies (from infection or immunisation) are protected against infection but this has not been confirmed in a trial. Note that a person’s antibody test may be positive for a period of time but may revert to negative should their immunity wane. We would expect this to correlate with a loss of protective immunity but this has not been studied. The immune response to COVID-19 is not yet fully understood. Virus particles can persist in body fluids for long periods and may lead to a positive test although the person might not be infectious. False positive tests can also occur. Alternatively, it is also possible that the virus particles may reactivate under certain conditions."
499,When can someone who has had COVID-19 stop isolating,"Different locations have different guidance and regulations about when someone with COVID-19 can be released from isolation. In some locations, for people to be released from hospital, two negative tests 48 hours apart are required. Most locations require no fever and no other symptoms (or at least an improvement of other symptoms), for at least two days. Always follow your local guidance."
500,Does COVID-19 spread through the air or air-conditioning,"COVID-19 is spread through droplets from an infected person to someone who is in close unprotected contact. There is increasing evidence that airborne transmission occurs. In the hospital setting, patients are currently managed in special 'negative pressure' rooms if available, and healthcare workers will take 'airborne precautions' when performing certain procedures. The Federation of European Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Associations REHVA experts provide guidance on COVID-19 for building services to prevent spread of SARS-CoV-2, with Frequently Asked Questions including the use of UV sterilisation of air. For more information, WHO has published Q&A on ventilation and air conditioning in public spaces and buildings and COVID-19."
501,Can the virus be transmitted through packages shipped from an area with COVID-19,"This coronavirus is primarily spreading to people who are in close unprotected direct contact with an infected person. The United States CDC advises ""Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads."""
502,Is protective equipment needed to handle a package shipped from an area with COVID-19,"The World Health Organization in its 6 April 2020 interim guidance on ‘Rational use of personal protective equipment for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and considerations during severe shortages’ does not recommend any type of mask is used, and gloves are only needed if they are ordinarily required to protect against mechanical hazards. “To date, there are no data to suggest that contact with goods or products shipped from countries affected by the COVID-19 outbreak have been the source of COVID-19 infection in humans.”"
503,Can COVID-19 spread through bank notes and coins,"Theoretically, cash, like any other frequently handled object, could become contaminated with the virus that causes COVID-19. People could potentially transfer the virus to their eyes / nose / mouth via their hands after handling cash. However the main way the disease is spreading is through direct contact with infected people. In 2006, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control issued a report that in part looked at the risk of bank notes as a potential vehicle for influenza transmission. It concluded that for the general public “handling banknotes and coins is not practically avoidable and will confer no discernible increased risk compared with handling almost any other communal object used in daily life; and compared with exposure to respiratory droplets (coughs and sneezes) and communal hard surfaces and fittings (hand rails, escalator hand belts, door handles, etc.) the ability of money to transmit influenza will pretty much pale into insignificance compared with what else is going on in society at the time. The overwhelmingly important issue will be compliance with frequent handwashing and 'no-touch-face' advice.” Individuals who frequently handle money might have an increased risk and are advised to avoid licking their fingers while counting, and not to touch their face during and after handling money.""Again these risks would be significantly reduced across a wide range of occupations by compliance with hand hygiene regimens and 'no-touch-face' advice."""
504,What about pets and other animals,"Some animals have tested positive for the virus following close contact with humans who were likely infected. So far, the data shows cats are the most commonly infected domestic animals. They can develop symptoms, and in a lab setting infected cats were able to spread the disease on to other cats. Pet cats have been found infected in Belgium, Hong Kong, China and and the United States. Tigers and lions at a zoo in New York were infected by a human caregiver. Several dogs have also tested positive. The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidelines for pet owners, including limiting a pet's exposure to people outside its household and reducing their contact with humans who have COVID-19. The World Organisation for Animal Heath's FAQ on pets and other animals is available here. They state, ""Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that animals infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19. Human outbreaks are driven by person to person contact."" There is no evidence that poultry, pigs or other livestock animals can be easily infected. Note that tests used on animals are different than those used to detect human infections."
505,Can I get infected with COVID-19 from food,"There is no evidence of COVID-19 transmission through food to date, and per the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the United States CDC. General food hygiene measures should be observed, especially washing hands thoroughly before preparing or eating food."
506,Can COVID-19 be treated,"There are currently no medications that are proven to be consistently effective in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Patients receive supportive care, aimed at relieving their symptoms and preventing complications while they recover. This can include the use of mechanical ventilation if required. Studies are underway to see if new or existing medications may be effective. These medications are generally available only on prescriptions, have significant side effects and potentially can cause serious adverse events. They should not be used except under the guidelines of local authorities or within hospital settings."
507,Is Tamiflu useful,The antiviral medication Tamiflu (oseltamivir) is not effective against COVID-19. Tamiflu is used to treat influenza.
508,What about alternative treatments,"Some authorities have recommended alternative treatments for COVID-19. However, there is no evidence to confirm or disprove the effectiveness and safety of alternative treatments."
509,"If I am sick in China, can I choose which clinic to go to","Certain medical facilities in China have been designated by the Department of Health as “fever clinics”. These fever clinics manage any patients who suffer from fever and respiratory symptoms. Other facilities are mandated to refer any patients with fever and respiratory symptoms to these dedicated fever clinics. If you are sick but do not have a fever or respiratory symptoms, then you can be treated in the non-fever clinic facilities. International SOS advises its members in China who are suffering from symptoms of illness to call the Assistance Centre for advice before seeking care at a medical facility."
510,What can I do to protect myself,"Avoid potential exposure. Practice good hygiene measures and safe food practices. Avoid direct contact with animals (live or dead) and their environment. Do not touch surfaces that may be contaminated with droppings. Keep some distance from people who are obviously sick. Maintain good personal hygiene. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water. Carry hand sanitiser for use when soap and water are not readily available. Some authorities are advising hand sanitisers containing 60-85% alcohol. Avoid touching your face. Ensure food, including eggs, is thoroughly cooked. Do not travel if you are sick. Note that some locations have implemented screening, and travellers may face quarantine and testing."
511,Should I wear a face mask,"If your location has guidelines for the public, please follow them. In some locations, authorities are requiring people to wear a mask when in public places. You must comply with any official directives. In late March 2020, Austria, Czech Republic, and Slovakia made it mandatory for people to wear a mask or use a cloth to cover their mouth and nose when in public places. In other locations, authorities are asking only people who are sick, or if they can't, those in close contact with them, to use a face mask to cover their coughs and sneezes while they are seeking medical attention. Other authorities encourage groups at higher risk for severe complications e.g. older adults or those with underlying illness, to consider wearing a mask. Some authorities have advised to use masks while travelling or working in public places to reduce the chances of droplet transmission. While surgical face masks may stop people touching their mouth, they do not stop them breathing in the virus, nor the virus entering the eyes. They will also catch some of the droplets that are coughed and sneezed out. Fitted respirators, such as ‘P2’, 'P3' or ‘N95’ masks, require training and fitting. These are generally not being recommended for use by the public. They may be recommended to be used by those in close contact with infected people, such as healthcare workers or family members caring for sick relatives.
The World Health Organization updated its interim guidance on 6 June to advise ""the general public should be encouraged to use medical and non-medical masks in areas with known or suspected community transmission”."
512,Should I wear a face shield,"The effectiveness of wearing a face shield to reduce the spray of droplets onto other people, is not fully understood. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) “does not recommend use of face shields for normal everyday activities or as a substitute for cloth face coverings.” In their recent interim guidance, the World Health Organization (WHO) advise “In the context of non-medical mask shortage, face shields may be considered as an alternative noting that they are inferior to masks with respect to prevention of droplet transmission.” Under certain circumstances, such as continued close contact with people, individuals may choose to wear a face shield as well as a mask. If face shields are used without a mask, it is important that the shield covers the sides of the face and below the chin. Disposable face shields should only be used once."
513,What is the difference between quarantine and isolation,"Quarantine is the separation and monitoring of people who have been exposed to an infected person (or have been to an outbreak area) to see if they become ill. This separation helps reduce the risk that the quarantined person will spread the disease. Quarantine generally requires a person to remain in a nominated place or at home for a certain period of time after exposure to a disease. The duration of quarantine will vary depending on the estimated incubation period. For COVID-19, early estimates indicate a quarantine duration of 14 days. Isolation is the separation of people who are ill with a potentially contagious disease from those who are healthy."
514,What environmental measures can be taken,"Environmental measures aim at reducing transmission of infection and include the routine cleaning of frequently used surfaces and objects; minimising shared objects; and good ventilation. Frequently touched surfaces and objects should be washed with water and detergent, followed by a dilute household bleach solution. These objects /surfaces may include desks, phones, keyboards, doorknobs and toilets. Laundry should be washed according to detergent manufacturer’s instructions at the warmest specified temperature. Shared objects should be kept to a minimum including such things as drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels and linen. Good air ventilation is important in rooms where people gather regularly."
515,A traveller has recently returned from an affected location. What should they do,"If there are local procedures in place from the local health authorities, these must be followed. Many locations are requiring travellers from some or all locations to quarantine themselves for 14 days.

If there are no requirements, anyone who has been in an affected location should monitor their health for 14 days. If symptoms develop, seek medical care according to the local procedure. When travelling to medical care, consider wearing a mask, use private transport, avoid contact with others as much as possible. Ensure you provide your travel and potential exposure history to the medical facility."
516,Should we stop face-to-face meetings,"If there are local restrictions on gatherings, you must comply with these. Any activity that involves gathering people in close proximity in an enclosed space risks spreading the virus and in the event that someone is confirmed infected, there are potentially large numbers of contacts who must self-quarantine for 14 days. Non-essential meetings are best postponed, or carried out via remote video link if possible."
518,What laboratory and imaging findings are characteristic of COVID-19,"Lymphopenia is the most common laboratory finding and may be present in up to 83% of hospitalized patients.
Elevated WBCs (white blood cells), LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), D-dimer, CRP (C-reactive protein), and ferritin may be associated with worse illness severity.
Chest x-ray may be normal early in the disease but progresses to bilateral, airspace consolidation.
Chest CT scan is often normal early in the disease. As the disease progresses chest CT scan abnormalities (eg, peripheral ground glass opacities) may develop but are not specific and overlap with other infections. Therefore, the American College of Radiology does not recommend chest CT for screening or as a first-line diagnostic test for COVID-19. "
519,What proportion of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic carriers,"Asymptomatic infection seems to be quite common, with reported incidence ranging from 13% to > 50%. However, because asymptomatic people have typically not been tested, the actual incidence is unknown. According to the CDC, the best estimate is that about 35% of people infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 are asymptomatic. Some patients diagnosed during the asymptomatic period progressed to symptomatic disease while others remained without symptoms."
520,What’s the incubation period for COVID-19,"An average of about 4 to 5 days, and almost always between 1 and 14 days. Almost 98% of people who develop symptoms will do so in 12 days or less after they become infected."
521,"What’s the case fatality rate for COVID-19, and what are significant risk factors for mortality","The Case Fatality Rate (%) = the number of deaths / the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases x 100 and therefore will depend on the number of people tested and their clinical status (ie, testing more minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic people will lead to lower case fatality estimates than when testing is concentrated on highly symptomatic patients as was done earlier in the pandemic). It is likely that many cases have not been tested and thus identified, whereas the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 are more accurately identified. Thus, the apparent risk of death varies widely depending on how much testing is done in a given region.

The risk of a COVID-19 infection resulting in death varies widely by a person's age and overall health. Older people are much more likely to die. Although death is uncommon in younger people, it does occur. We don’t fully understand why some younger people are susceptible.

Other factors that make death more likely are serious disorders such as

Heart and lung disorders
Disorders or use of drugs that interfere with the immune system
Longstanding cigarette smoking
Chronic kidney disease
Diabetes
Cancer
Hypertension
Liver disease
Severe obesity
Prior stroke

People who have these disorders may be able to decrease their risk by keeping the disorder under control (for example, maintaining the best levels of blood sugar or blood pressure).

A preliminary study suggested that people with type A blood may be at significantly higher risk of respiratory failure due to COVID-19 while type O blood may be protective. "
522,How long does the COVID-19 illness last,"Much about this is still unknown. However, mild disease tends to subside in about 2 weeks. If disease is severe, median time to development of dyspnea is 5 to 8 days and to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is 8 to 12 days. Among hospitalized patients, 26% to 32% were admitted to the ICU. Mortality among ICU patients ranges from 39% to 72%. The median length of hospitalization among survivors was 10 to 13 days.

"
523,What precautions should I take to prevent COVID-19 in clinical practice,"Follow the procedures and guidelines of your particular institution and practice, but in general, in addition to routine precautions of frequent, thorough handwashing and surface disinfecting, CDC recommendations (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinic-preparedness.html) include the following:

Use telemedicine as much as possible (eg, for follow-ups, triage of complaints).
Consider rescheduling non-urgent appointments.
Post signs at entrances and in waiting areas about prevention actions.
Allow patients to wait outside or in the car if they are medically able.
Establish a separate, well-ventilated triage area with some barrier between patient and staff.
In the waiting area and patient rooms, provide tissues, alcohol-based hand rub, soap at sinks, and trash cans. Place chairs 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart, when possible. Use barriers (like screens), if possible.
If your office has toys, reading materials, or other communal objects, remove them or clean them regularly.
Screen patients for respiratory symptoms and fever or other signs of infectious illness and isolate symptomatic patients as soon as possible.
For COVID-19 positive patients, undiagnosed patients whose symptoms could be COVID-19, and patients within high-risk units (eg, ED, ICU), wear personal protective equipment (PPE), including a respirator (eg, N-95 or similar level of protection), face shield, gown, and gloves. Change PPE, at a minimum gown and gloves, between patients, washing hands before and after. If supplies of respirators are insufficient, change respirator at least daily and follow CDC guidance on cleaning and reuse (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/decontamination-reuse-respirators.html) as well as CDC guidance on optimizing the supply of PPE (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/index.html)"
524,What is the incidence of COVID-19 in infants and children,"While it appears that children are at similar risk of infection from COVID-19 as adults, it is not possible to know the true incidence of infection; given that disease manifestations in children are much milder, testing is done less often in children. A just-published study in Pediatrics (DOI: 10.1542/peds.2020-0702), based on the experience in China with more than 2,000 children under the age of 18, showed that children of all ages appeared susceptible to COVID-19. More than a third of the children tested were confirmed to have been infected with the virus. Greater than 90% of pediatric patients experienced asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease, while around 6% of children developed severe or critical illness."
525,Can pets get COVID-19 or spread it to people,"Other coronaviruses cause disease in animals that can be spread to humans, but this is rare. However, there are isolated reports from outside the US of a few companion animals testing positive for COVID-19 after prolonged contact with humans. There are also reports of 2 cats in separate locations in New York State with COVID-19 infections which they likely caught from their owners. These 2 cats had mild symptoms. Also, tigers in a New York City zoo with symptomatic respiratory illness, including cough, were found to have COVID-19 infection.

Researchers in China have published a study online showing that domestic cats can be experimentally infected with the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Cats given a high dose of the virus were also able to infect cats housed in adjacent cages, suggesting aerosol spread. Whether cats can serve as a reservoir host of the virus or transmit it to people has not been determined, but the risk of cats as a source of infection appears to be low. The researchers also attempted infection in ferrets, dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks. The virus replicated poorly in dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks, but efficiently in ferrets and cats.

Importantly, there is no evidence that pets can pass the COVID-19 virus infection to humans. However, until the situation is clearer, CDC recommends (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html) that pets not interact with people or animals outside the household. People with COVID-19 infection should limit contact with their pets and they and others in the household should wash their hands before and after contact with their pets."
526,Are patients who recover from COVID-19 clinical infection immune? How about asymptomatic carriers,"Antibodies to SARS CoV-2 develop within a few days of infection, including in asymptomatic people. However, it is too early to tell whether antibody titers will be adequate to induce immunity to repeat infection and, if so, for how long. Studies done of other human coronavirus infections showed that immunity to the strains that cause colds typically lasts only a few months. Studies following the original SARS outbreak in the early 2000s showed that antibody levels to that coronavirus dropped significantly after about three years. The best current estimate is that most patients who had COVID-19 infection will have some immunity but that it is probably not lifelong.  "
527,When will a COVID-19 vaccine be available,"For extensive information on vaccines in development for COVID-19

 https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/30/opinion/coronavirus-covid-vaccine.html
 "
528,How important is lockdown in slowing COVID-19 transmission,"While efforts to develop treatments and vaccines are progressing rapidly, it will still be some time before testing is complete and they will become available to the general population. Until then, the only intervention available to help people stay healthy in areas with significant COVID-19 is to break the transmission cycle by extreme social distancing (that is, a lockdown). The purpose of a lockdown is to decrease the likelihood that uninfected people will come into contact with infected people or surfaces contaminated by coronavirus. Only by decreasing the opportunity for the virus to spread will the pandemic be slowed and eventually controlled. In countries where this strategy was practiced, the infection rate and death rate indeed seem to be slowing. Areas with limited disease presence and transmission that have appropriate testing and tracking capability may consider less stringent measures than full lockdown (eg, physical distancing, mask wearing, and limiting size of gatherings).

 "
529,Can we identify which COVID-19 patients are going to decompensate and how quickly,"The greatest risk factor for severe illness, complications, and death is

Age

The risk of a COVID-19 infection resulting in death varies widely by a person's age.Older people are more likely to die.


Other important risk factors from CDC are underlying medical conditions.  Early case fatality data show

No underlying medical conditions: 0.9%
Cardiovascular disease: 10.5%
Diabetes: 7.3%
Chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer about 6% each
Heart disease, hypertension, prior stroke, diabetes, chronic lung disease, and chronic kidney disease have all been associated with increased disease severity and worse outcomes.


For hospitalized patients who have COVID-19, factors associated with increased risk of decompensation and death include

Lymphopenia, neutrophilia
Elevated LDH, CRP, ALT, AST, and ferritin levels
Elevated D-dimer levels
 "
530,Who should have a COVID-19 test,"The following patients should have SARS-CoV-2 testing with viral tests (ie, nucleic acid or antigen tests) 

Individuals with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19
Asymptomatic individuals with recent known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 to control transmission
Other special circumstances (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html)
Practitioners are also encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness such as influenza and bacterial pneumonia.
"
531,What is the role of the COVID-19 antibody test,"Tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are now available. As with other serologic tests for infections, this test is good for diagnosing previous infection, but because of the lag in developing antibody titers is not a good test for initial diagnosis and/or screening.

One use of antibody assays is for a person suspected to have post-infectious syndrome (eg, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

It is, of course, too early to tell what titer of antibodies is protective and for how long.

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/testing.ht

 "
532,Is it safe to exercise outside in public,"Solitary exercise in public (eg, walking, jogging, or hiking) is thought to be safe when done alone or with a person one lives with, but when other people are nearby, people should wear a mask and maintain social distancing (> 6 feet) from the others. Group sports (eg, basketball, soccer) are not recommended as the nature of the activity makes appropriate distancing impossible.

It might also be prudent to wear a mask and eye protection and maintain greater than standard social distancing from heavily exercising people (eg, runners, bikers) who are likely to be exhaling more heavily and thus potentially creating a larger zone of contaminated, exhaled air; however, these are not formal recommendations."
533,What are the similarities between COVID-19 and TB,"For COVID-19, the risk of developing disease is not yet so well-known, but evidence to date suggests that older age and having comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease, are important risk factors of a poor outcome. It is not yet clear whether having comorbid lung disease like TB, or other infections such as HIV, will increase the severity of COVID-19 if infected with SARS-CoV-2, but there is increasing evidence that having chronic respiratory disease increases the chance of poor outcomes with COVID. Both COVID-19 and TB cause respiratory symptoms – cough and shortness of breath. Both cause fever and weakness. One of the biggest differences is the speed of onset. TB symptoms do not tend to occur immediately after infection and when they develop, but are of a gradual onset, often over a period of weeks or longer, unlike COVID-19, where symptoms can occur within a few days. TB usually has a period of time where bacteria are present in a person but the person is well and not infectious to others. During this time, the person has TB infection (sometimes referred to as latent TB), which has the potential to become TB disease in the future. Thus, a person exposed to TB bacteria may: become sick within weeks (likely due to a weakened immune system); sick after years of carrying the bacteria when the immune system becomes weakened and cannot fight off the disease anymore; or infected but never sick."
534,How deadly is COVID-19 compared to TB,"The data regarding COVID-19 are changing daily (check the WHO Situational Dashboard for the latest figures), but the number of deaths due to COVID-19 is increasing daily. About 1.5 million people died from TB in 2018 and, of this total, over 250,000 were HIV positive. This relates to more than 4,000 deaths a day due to TB.

Mortality (death) rates determine the frequency of deaths in a specified population during a specified interval of time. With a novel disease like COVID-19, however, mortality rates are unreliable at this point in time due to a variety of factors. The COVID-19 mortality estimate may be unknown as we do not know exactly how many cases there are. This is due to underreporting and people with minimal or mild symptoms not being tested, and therefore not being factored into the total number of confirmed cases. This subsequently makes mortality estimates difficult. Some reports estimate mortality rates for COVID-19 anywhere from 1.5 to 20 percent, 20 percent being one of the highest estimates at the centre of the outbreak in Wuhan, China. In contrast, untreated TB has an average mortality rate of 45 percent. However, TB is not only preventable but treatable, and the global success rate reported by the WHO for those who started TB treatment in 2018 was 85 percent.

Thus, TB is technically deadlier than COVID-19, though one must consider the diseases themselves and other risk factors: age, HIV status, the quality of the body’s immune systems, etc. People with active, untreated TB are far more likely to die than even the highest projected mortality estimates for COVID-19, making it critical to address prevention and treatment options for TB. The advantage for TB is that we do have treatments that work, including for drug-resistant forms of TB. We also have treatments for the TB infection stage to prevent a person from becoming unwell with TB.

The co-infection of TB and COVID-19 is still being discussed, but there is the possibility both could exacerbate the natural symptoms of the other and have negative impacts on a person’s health."
535,"I am taking TB treatment, is there any guidance or recommendations for what a person on TB treatment should do if they get infected with COVID-19","Currently there is no recommended drug treatment for COVID-19 and it is currently being managed by addressing a person’s symptoms. There is a large therapeutics trial, the SOLIDARITY trial, which may give more details on drug treatments for COVID-19 and many smaller trials are also underway. There is no vaccine currently to protect against COVID-19.

It is important that if you are experiencing mild symptoms that are similar to those of COVID-19, that you continue taking your TB treatment in order to completely cure your TB. There is no evidence currently that TB medications increase your risk of developing COVID-19.

If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, let the healthcare provider know that you are on TB treatment and inform your TB care provider. If you are started on any treatment for COVID-19, your care provider can check to make sure there are no interactions with other medications."
536,"What symptoms should I look for to know if I have either TB or COVID-19, given that some of the symptoms are the same","the symptoms of COVID-19 can be similar to those of TB, with fever, cough and shortness of breath among the symptoms, but there is usually a difference in the speed that the symptoms start. COVID-19 symptoms are likely to be of more recent onset.

If you come into contact with someone known to have either TB or COVID-19, that increases your chance of having these diseases. Additionally, if you have been to an area with high TB rates or high rates of COVID-19, this information can also help your care provider in finding out the cause of your symptoms. 

If you are unwell and are showing the above symptoms and have a positive contact or travel history for either TB or COVID and/or have risk factors for either as outlined above, it is important that you are tested for both TB and COVID. When you visit the healthcare facility, let them know your symptoms and any risk factors you may have for either TB or COVID-19 so they can ensure the appropriate infection prevention and control measures can be implemented while the diagnosis is sought. (Infection prevention and control is the term that is used to help protect infections from being spread and includes things like hand washing, ensuring adequate space around someone with symptoms and barriers like masks and gloves.)

Tests for TB usually include testing sputum for TB bacteria. COVID-19 tests require either an upper respiratory nasopharyngeal (nasal) swab or a sputum test. If there are respiratory symptoms, a chest X-ray may be required to further refine the diagnosis and/or establish the severity of the illness.

In countries that have a high burden of TB, it is particularly important that people continued to be screened and tested for TB with tests for SARS-CoV-2offered in line with the national guidelines."
537,"I have recovered from TB, am I at greater risk of getting infected with COVID-19","As COVID-19 is so new, there are no data currently on if those with or who have a previous history of TB are more at risk of worse outcomes. However, COVID-19 affects the lungs, and as we know that there is usually some left-over damage in the lungs following TB disease, which may put you at increased risk of developing more severe COVID-19 symptoms.

People who have had TB, particularly those who may have required lung surgery or who have been diagnosed with post-TB lung disease should consider limiting their exposure to high risk environments - this depends on your national situation with regards to the likelihood of COVID-19 circulating in your community. The key ways to protect yourself from COVID-19 include:

Regular hand-washing using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub
Social distancing - maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Good respiratory hygiene by covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze, then disposing of the used tissue immediately.
Avoid touching your face, mouth or eyes
In addition to the advice regarding regular handwashing, regular cleaning of surfaces and practicing social distancing measures, some of the ways to protect yourself include keeping in good general health. It has been shown that tobacco use (including tobacco smoking, vaping and using e-cigarettes) are at an increased risk of developing a more severe COVID-19 disease. If you do use tobacco products, it would be recommended to stop – this will not only protect you from severe COVID-19 disease but will be good for your lung health in general and also protect you from TB."
538,Do I need to wear a mask,"Wearing a mask presents a barrier for the spread of both TB and COVID-19 as masks stop them from being distributed into the air if being worn by someone who has symptoms or being inhaled by or touched by others in the immediate environment.

Masks have been used in TB infection prevention and control for many years to reduce the risk of further spread of TB amongst family members of the affected person, the community and healthcare workers. For TB, as there is an effective treatment available, once a person is on the right treatment the risk of infecting others rapidly decreases and there is often no need to wear a mask.

For COVID-19, the WHO recommends that masks be worn by persons with symptoms but discourages healthy people from wearing masks in general. There is some evidence from China that voluntary wearing of masks by healthy or asymptomatic people in the community can help decrease the spread of COVID-19.

Mask wearing is part of a package of infection prevention and control interventions, and in isolation is likely to have a minimal impact on the transmission of TB or COVID-19. If you are at risk and in a high burden context (for either TB or COVID-19), adding mask-wearing to regular hand washing, social distancing, and cough hygiene practices may offer additional protection.

"
539,How will the TB response be affected,"There are guidelines regarding the management of TB in emergencies that can help countries plan to ensure that TB services remain operational. It is very important that national TB services continue and that people have access to diagnostic services, treatments and support services for TB during this time of COVID-19. Given the impact that COVID-19 has had in countries with increasing cases, there are a number of risks for the TB response.

National TB programme staff being drafted into the COVID-19 response, creating staff shortages or increased workloads
National laboratory and diagnostic services focusing on COVID-19 activities, such that TB laboratory tests like rapid molecular tests and cultures are delayed and there is limited access to chest X-rays
Drug stock-outs and procurement issues. As global transport networks are reduced and countries involved in the manufacture of TB medications are affected, there may be delays in the procurement chain. If health systems are overwhelmed or there are staff shortages, stock management may be de-prioritised.
Social distancing measures and national quarantine measures may interrupt treatment support and TB contact tracing measures.
These are all risks that national TB programmes, WHO, donors and implementing partners need to work together to plan for and put in strategies to avoid. "
540,Do I need to stockpile my TB medicines,"There are concerns regarding the global supply of medications.  Currently, none of the first-line TB drugs are being used for the management of COVID-19, and as such, there is not expected to be a re-directing of the medications themselves to people with COVID-19. High burden TB countries should have procurement and supply management systems in place to ensure adequate supplies of TB medications and timely ordering of new drugs to avoid stock-outs. International procurement agencies, such as the Stop TB Partnership’s TB Global Drug Facility, are working with governments to ensure TB supply chains are not affected. 

If you are on TB treatment, you should continue to take your medication as prescribed and keep your appointments with your care provider for medication refills. Given the rapidly evolving situation for COVID-19, when you next have an appointment with your care provider, it would be worth discussing options for medication refills if national quarantine measures are put in place."
541,What alternatives are available to ensure people in treatment for TB can continue to be given the proper support and supervision if directly observed therapy (DOT) is restricted due to social distancing and national quarantine measures,"Social distancing is a type of measure used by public health officials to slow down or stop the spread of a disease, especially to allow healthcare systems a chance to ensure care can be offered to everyone who needs it. For social distancing, people are advised to stay at least one metre (three feet) away from each other to limit the spread of COVID-19, prompting many officials worldwide to cancel large scale events and gatherings in order to mitigate the spread of disease.

In many TB programmes, the daily observation of a person with TB taking medications is part of the treatment package for people with TB. Where daily observation of treatment is being recommended as a standard of care, it should be not only for the recording of medication adherence but to check for any side effects or issues with the treatment as well as offering support to the person with TB.

While the spread of COVID-19 continues, models of care that involve regular close contact may need to be reconsidered, particularly if national quarantine measures are put in place. There are alternatives to daily observed therapy (DOT), which can include self-administered therapy (SAT) and support utilising digital platforms such as video-observed therapy (VOT) and other mobile phone-supported adherence strategies, such as 99DOTS. There is increasing evidence that these, when implemented as part of a comprehensive package of care, can have the same outcomes as DOT and are often a more patient-centred approach to care.  While some of these systems require time and digital/mobile technologies to be implemented, TB programmes with large numbers of people using DOT should consider what options can be implemented in a short period of time, including prioritising DOT for those who need more support through their treatment and moving the majority to SAT.

If DOT approaches have to be quickly withdrawn from people on TB treatment due to national quarantine procedures, it is vital that TB programmes have a system in place to continue to support people on TB treatment, to ensure that any side effects from the medications can be addressed as well as support any psycho-social issues.

"
542,"I keep reading about new treatments and novel ways to protect yourself from COVID-19, how do I know if they are true","SARS-CoV-2 is a very new virus and we are learning new things about it every day with regards to how it spreads, how we can protect ourselves from it, treatments that may be able to prevent you from falling ill or treat you if you become unwell with COVID-19. The best way to check the information that you are reading or that is being shared is to check reputable websites. The WHO updates its website daily with information on all aspects of COVID-19 (here). The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website also has regular updates on COVID-19 (here). These websites are reputable and trustworthy sources for the latest evidence and knowledge with regards to COVID-19."
543,What can I do to reduce stigma related to COVID-19 and other communicable diseases,"We have learned from our experience with TB of the effects of stigma on people with or at risk of disease and the importance of the language we use when describing the illness. We have seen the similar use of stigmatising language by the media and others when discussing people who have COVID-19. It is important that we adhere to the language guidance issued by WHO, which mirrors many of the lessons we have learned in TB to minimise stigma experienced by people affected by COVID-19.

Stigma can be one of the most powerful barriers to delivering prevention, treatment and care to those most in need, and can negatively affect those with the disease, as well as their caregivers, family, friends and communities.  It is important that we refer to the virus by its name, not by the place of origin or the region that the virus initially affected.

Person-centred language is language that respects and empowers people, putting the person before the disease. For example, say “person with COVID-19” or “person showing symptoms of COVID-19” rather than using phrases like “COVID-19 victims” or “suspected cases”. The language we use shapes our understanding of the situation, and it is essential that we avoiding blaming others or ostracising a person who may be ill with disease. Read the WHO’s guidance on stigma for more information."
546,Am i risk to covid-19,"At this time, COVID-19 is widespread throughout many communities within the United States, and it is essential to continue to practice social distancing (and other measures as recommended by your local or national governments) to protect yourself and your family from coming into contact with the virus.You may be particularly at risk for getting the virus if you have traveled to an area with widespread transmission or live in an area of the country with a particularly high number of cases. If you live in Pennsylvania, the state government updates information on the number of cases in Pennsylvania
by county every day.You should discuss with your primary care doctor if you are concerned about exposure to people with known COVID-19 infection, or if you have symptoms such as fever and cough or shortness of breath"
547,What is a coronavirus,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19."
558,Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19,"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines."
561,Should I wear a mask to protect myself,Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask.
566,Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported,"Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low."
568,How long can coronavirus last on different surfaces,"Viruses remain infectious on cardboard for 24 hours, and 3 days on plastic and stainless steel. So don't fail to wash up after touching these surfaces."
569,Can I bring someone with me to my scheduled appointment,"We have taken a number of steps to ensure our facilities are safe to protect our caregivers and patients and help limit the spread of COVID-19. As the pandemic continues, we designed visitation policy that will adjust as COVID fluctuates within our states. Please see our current visitor restrictions."
570,How covid-19 spread,"COVID-19 is spread from person to person in a fashion similar to that of other respiratory viruses: You can get the virus from inhaling particles sprayed into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, especially if you are within six feet of an infected person. You can also get the virus from touching a surface that an infected person coughed or sneezed on and then transferring the virus to your body by touching your eyes, nose or mouth."
571,How is covid-19 diagnosed,"For people who have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 infection, testing is done through a swab of your nose and throat that is tested for evidence of the virus. Penn Medicine is performing this test in our laboratory and also sending testing to outside commercial labs for patients suspected of COVID-19 infection. Your health care provider will determine whether testing is appropriate for you based on your symptoms and exposure history."
572,What are the progonis for the people who get covid-19,"Importantly, MOST people with COVID-19 do well and recover fully within a week or two of their illness. Even though there are no specific treatments or vaccines for the COVID-19 virus at this time, most people are cured by their own immune system and recover fully."
573,What are the most common myths about COVID-19 that physicians should dispel for patients,"Misinformation about COVID-19 is being shared across social media and other platforms at alarming speed.Physicians will want to address common myths on the spread of the virus, prevention efforts, treatment options and potential cures that could negatively impact patient health."
574,What should I tell my patients about traveling during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Misinformation about COVID-19 is being shared across social media and other platforms at alarming speed.Physicians will want to address common myths on the spread of the virus, prevention efforts, treatment options and potential cures that could negatively impact patient health.Travel dramatically increases an individual’s chance of getting infected and infecting others and should be undertaken with caution.The CDC recommends that travelers postpone all non-essential travel outside of the U.S. Individuals who must travel internationally should be aware that plans are likely to be disrupted by canceled flights, mandatory quarantines and closed borders.In terms of domestic travel, the CDC recommends you stay home as much as possible and practice social distancing. Be aware that some communities within the U.S. may require visitors to quarantine for 14 days upon entering a community or when returning home from a trip"
575,What is the purpose of antibody (or serology) tests and when do I use them,"Antibody test looks for antibodies that are made by the immune system in response to a threat. Antibodies can take several days or weeks to develop after you have an infection and may stay in your blood for several weeks after recovery. As a result, antibody tests should not be used to diagnose an active coronavirus infection.Use of antibody tests should currently be limited to population-level seroprevalance study, evaluation of recovered individuals for convalescent plasma donations. Antibody tests should not be offered to individuals as a method of determining immune status. Individuals receiving positive test results may falsely assume it is safe to discontinue physical distancing.For additional information see the CDC’s overview of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and the FDA’s coronavirus testing basics (PDF). The AMA has also developed guidance on antibody tests."
576,How do I treat patients with confirmed COVID-19,"People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms either at home or in a clinical setting as symptoms demand. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.At present, no drug has been proven to be safe and effective for treating COVID-19. There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs specifically to treat patients with COVID-19.Some patients with COVID-19 have received intravenous remdesivir, an investigational antiviral drug that was reported to have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, for compassionate use outside of a clinical trial setting.As of June 15, the FDA has revoked emergency use
authorization of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19.In the event that an adverse drug event is suspected or observed from any medication used to prevent or treat COVID-19, we urge health care providers to submit a report to FDA MedWatch. COVID-19 or coronavirus should be referenced in the report to the FDA.Read the NIH Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Treatment Guidelines."
577,How can health care facilities manage PPE supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The CDC’s updated infection prevention and control guidance (as of March 10) notes that face masks are an acceptable alternative when the supply chain of respirators cannot meet the demand. In this case, respirators should be prioritized for procedures likely to generate respiratory aerosols, which pose the highest risk to health care professionals.If there are shortages of gowns, they should be prioritized for aerosol-generating procedures, care activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated, and high-contact patient care activities that provide opportunities for transfer of pathogens to the hands and clothing of HCP."
578,What should physicians do when they have been exposed to COVID-19,"All health care professionals are at some risk for exposure to COVID-19, whether in the workplace or in the community.Health care professionals in any of the risk exposure categories (high, medium, low or no risk) who develop signs or symptoms compatible with COVID-19 must contact their established point of contact (public health authorities or their facility’s occupational health program) for medical evaluation prior to returning to work.Facilities could consider allowing asymptomatic health care professionals who have had an exposure to a patient with COVID-19 to continue to work after options to improve staffing have been exhausted and in consultation with their occupational health program."
579,What can physicians do to manage increased capacity and conserve PPE in practices and health systems,"PPE remains difficult to obtain as health care facilities and physician practices return to business as usual during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Having patients opt for telehealth visits offers an opportunity to conserve PPE, but non-urgent procedures and other in-person visits cannot be delayed indefinitely. Engineering and administrative jobs can also prevent unnecessary exposures at health care facilities and optimize PPE supplies, but further action is needed to preserve staff, personal protective equipment and patient care supplies while also ensuring staff and patient safety and expanding available hospital capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic"
580,What options are available for private practices to continue to treat patients during the pandemic,"Private practices have the option to utilize telehealth to treat patients outside the exam room. Given the special circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government announced that the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) would not impose penalties on physicians using telehealth in the event of noncompliance with regulatory requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) during the crisis."
581,How do physicians enforce quarantine while respecting patients’ autonomy,"A physician’s primary duty during a public health emergency like the COVID pandemic is to protect the health of the community. In a quarantine situation, each individual physician’s role is to engender cooperation by communicating clearly and by acknowledging the natural fears and feelings of powerlessness that infectious disease outbreaks create. In some circumstances, however, when persuasion fails and a patient poses a risk to others but won't voluntarily adhere to isolation, physicians should support mandatory quarantine."
582,How do physicians respond to colleagues who fail to report an exposure to COVID-19,"No one relishes the prospect of confronting a friend, but when a colleague poses a threat to patient welfare, physicians are ethically obligated to report their suspicions in the interest of patient safety."
583,How do I know when it is safe for patients to discontinue home isolation,"As of July 20, persons with COVID-19 who have symptoms and were directed to care for themselves at home may discontinue isolation under the following conditions:At least 10 days* have passed since symptom onset and At least 24 hours have passed since resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and Other symptoms have improved A limited number of persons with severe illness may produce replication-competent virus beyond 10 days, that may warrant extending duration of isolation for up to 20 days after symptom onset. Consider consultation with infection control experts."
584,How do I establish effective staff safety protocols,"When communicating with staff, the CDC recommends that health care facilities are aware of the following best practices: Implement source control for all visitors, patients and staff entering your practice or health care facility, regardless of symptoms. Encourage patients and visitors to wear cloth masks when visiting to prevent transmission from non-symptomatic individuals. Screen patients and visitors for symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., fever, cough, difficulty breathing) before entering your health care facility. Ensure proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE).Conduct an inventory of available PPE. Encourage sick employees to stay home"
585,"How are
patients with COVID-19 monitored at home","Patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 may be supported from home by a team of Penn Medicine doctors and nurses using two remote monitoring programs. These remote monitoring programs are used by patients with the virus who are well enough to recover from home after they’ve been discharged from Penn Medicine emergency departments and hospitals, as well as patients who are confirmed or likely to have COVID-19 but not sick enough to need hospitalization.
COVID Watch is an automated text messaging system that provides 24/7 clinical feedback and support. Patients enrolled in the program receive check-in messages every morning and afternoon. At any time, patients can also text the word “worse” to receive a call from a Penn Medicine clinician within 1 hour.COVID Pulse is a program that allows patients to monitor their oxygen levels at home with a pulse oximeter device, also known as a “pulse ox.” This device measures oxygen levels to help 
"
586,"If I have COVID-19, when can I end home
isolation","People with COVID-19 who have stayed home (are home isolated) can stop home isolation under the following conditions.If they will not have a test to determine if they are still contagious, they can leave home after these three things have happened: They have had no fever for at least 72 hours (that is three full days of no fever without the use medicine that reduces fevers) AND other symptoms have improved (for example, when their cough or shortness of breath have improved) AND at least 10 days have passed since their symptoms first appeared.If they will be tested to determine if they are still contagious, they can leave home after these three things have happened: They no longer have a fever (without the use medicine that reduces fevers) AND other symptoms have improved (for example, when their cough or shortness of breath have improved) AND they received two negative tests in a row, 24 hours apart."
587,How can I safely grocery shop,"Yes, you can safely go grocery shopping, but the best way to protect yourself and others is to limit exposure to the grocery store. This can be done by ordering delivery if that is possible, or reducing the number of shopping trips you take. Try to only go to the store every one or two weeks. Also try to limit the number of people who go on shopping trips. Leave your kids at home if you can as they like to touch surfaces and can carry the virus without showing symptoms."
588,"How do I protect myself if I have been around
someone who is infected with COVID-19","The CDC has excellent advice to help prevent household members from getting infection if someone in the home has COVID-19. These include sleeping in separate rooms, using separate bathrooms if possible, frequent hand-washing and staying more than six feet away from the infected person."
589,"How do I protect myself and others from COVID-19
infection","At present, there are no available vaccines to prevent COVID-19 infection, or treatments to cure this infection. However, research and clinical trials are being done to create a vaccine and study possible drugs that have activity against the virus."
590,"What does it mean to be immunocompromised during
COVID-19","Being immunocompromised means that your immune system's defenses are low, affecting its ability to fight off illness and infection, including COVID-19. Certain conditions like autoimmune diseases (i.e., lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and Type 1 diabetes), your age, and a history of smoking could increase the chance of infection. Medical treatments, such as cancer treatments and organ and bone marrow transplants, can also weaken or suppress the immune system."
591,Is it safe to travel,"Because of widespread community COVID-19 illness in some places, the CDC recommends Americans avoid all non-essential travel, both domestic and international. The CDC has detailed advice regarding travel."
592,Is it safe to go on a cruise,"No, it is not safe to go on a cruise. Cruises put large numbers of people, often from countries around the world, in frequent and close contact with each other. Sustained community spread of COVID-19 has been associated with several recent cruise events. In addition, those traveling by ship may be impacted by travel restrictions affecting their itineraries or ability to disembark, or may be subject to quarantine procedures implemented by the local authorities. The CDC has implemented a No Sail Order for cruise ships effective March 14, 2020, lasting for the next 30 days."
593,"Is it safe for me to go to my upcoming doctor's
appointment","We are taking extra steps to make sure all care environments and operating rooms are safe for patients and providers. We regularly and rigorously clean and disinfect waiting rooms and patient care areas; require masks or face coverings for all staff, patients and visitors; have made it easier to maximize physical distancing in our facilities; and implemented new processes such as contact-less check-in and check-out."
594,"What should I do to prepare to come in for an
appointment or surgery","One day before your appointment, we will send you an automated text or call to screen you for COVID-19 symptoms. If you have any symptoms that could be consistent with COVID-19 (these include fevers, chills, cough, loss of sense of taste or smell, muscle pain, headache, or sore throat), a Penn Medicine nurse will follow up with you to review your symptoms and determine next steps."
595,"Is there someone I can talk to if I feel anxious or
scared about my appointment or surgery","If you feel anxious or have concerns about coming in for care, call our hotline at 833-983-1350 to speak with us. We also can connect you with a behavioral health specialist who can talk with you about your concerns."
596,"What is Penn Medicine's visitation policy during
COVID-19","Currently, we have practices in place, including limiting visitors, to maximize the safety of all who enter our hospitals and facilities."
597,"How is Penn Medicine prioritizing which types of
patients should have surgery","We are prioritizing patients for surgery based on their medical condition, their risk for disease progression, their decision to have surgery or procedure, and available resources."
598,Can I postpone my surgery,It is important that you discuss whether to postpone your surgery with your doctor. You and your surgeon can make an informed decision together based on your specific medical condition.
599,"I have a lab order from my physician. How long
will it take to get done","The Laboratory Patient Service Centers are prioritizing orders for patients who require urgent laboratory testing. If you have non-urgent lab testing orders, we ask that you postpone those orders. If you are not sure how long you can safely delay, please speak with your provider."
600,"Do I need to test negative for COVID-19 before I
have my surgery? What happens if I test positive","You must be tested for COVID-19 within two days of the surgery. If the SARS-CoV-2 virus associated with COVID-19 was NOT detected in your test, your surgery will proceed as planned. If you test positive, you and your surgeon will make a decision regarding whether you can safely delay your procedure. We have practices in place to be able to perform emergency surgeries safely on patients with COVID-19."
602,"Are my doctors and nurses being screened and
tested for COVID-19","All staff, including physicians, surgeons and nurses, are being screened for COVID-19 symptoms and exposures before entering any of our facilities. Staff with any symptoms of COVID-19 are being tested, and staff with possible exposure to COVID-19 may require quarantine for a period of time prior to returning to work."
603,"What is antibody testing? How do I get a COVID-19
antibody test","CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once. At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others. Serology testing, or antibody testing, checks a sample of a person’s blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus. We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus and if they do, how long this protection will last. At Penn Medicine, antibody testing is available for patients with specific clinical indications. While there is discussion about using these tests to determine who can safely go back to work, this is not yet in practice since we do not know if antibodies confer immunity. We are working to validate commercial antibody tests and make them more widely available. If you have additional questions about whether you are eligible for antibody testing, please contact your regular medical provider."
604,"Will I need to come in for a follow-up, or can
that be done with telemedicine",Your doctor will let you know if you need an in-person visit or if you can have a post-surgical follow-up visit by telephone or video.
605,"I need bandages to dress my wound. What if I need
care items that are not easy to get right now",We can arrange a home care visit and provide you with the supplies you need.
606,"What if I need post-operative rehabilitation or
physical therapy","Your care team will work with you to identify the most appropriate post-operative plan, specific to your surgery and individual needs. Options may range from home with self-care or skilled-care (nursing & therapy) to more intensive rehabilitation services in a skilled nursing facility, acute rehabilitation hospital or specialty hospital."
607,Do I need to self-quarantine after surgery,Quarantine is only necessary if you have been exposed to a person with COVID-19 or if you have tested positive.
608,"Since I scheduled my appointment or surgery, I
lost my job and no longer have health insurance (or my insurance changed). What
should I do","We offer programs to help you determine the best options for your unique financial situation. If you have limited or no health insurance, or are on a fixed or limited income, you are encouraged to contact our financial advocates"
609,"I am a Penn Medicine employee. What resources are
available to support me through COVID-19","We recognize the uncertainty and challenges that the evolving COVID-19 pandemic poses to you, your loved ones, and your work. Thank you for your continued service to ensure the health and safety of all our patients, their families, and our staff."
610,"Does Penn Medicine have information about
COVID-19 that I can share with others",Yes. You can print out and distribute our COVID-19 Guide [7.66 Mb] which contains information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about how to manage COVID-19 in your home and in your community
611,Are certain racial or ethnic groups at a higher risk of developing severe illness with COVID-19,"African Americans are more likely to acquire and die from complications of the COVID-19 virus because Blacks suffer from higher rates of chronic medical conditions like diabetes and obesity, high blood pressure, heart and kidney disease and asthma. All of these lower the immune system and the ability to fight off viruses. Additionally, lifestyle factors like being an essential worker and even using public transportation increase the risk of getting COVID-19."
612,What safety measures does Cleveland Clinic have in place to help ensure the safety of patients who need care,"During this unprecedented time, Cleveland Clinic has taken a number of steps to help limit the spread of COVID-19 and ensure our hospitals are safe for caregivers and patients. This includes providing appropriate personal protective equipment for caregivers, offering masks to patients, visitors, caregivers and vendors, limiting access into our facilities, limiting visitation, canceling public events and checking the temperature of everyone who enters our doors."
613,"I have an appointment at Cleveland Clinic, and I am concerned about COVID-19. What safety measures are in place to protect me",The safety of our patients and caregivers remains our top priority. We want to assure patients that our Cleveland Clinic facilities are safe for them to receive care.
614,What are Cleveland Clinic’s mask guidelines,"As we learn more about COVID-19 and its transmission, we are adapting our practices in order to provide the safest care to our patients and protect our caregivers. In alignment with guidelines from the CDC and direction from our state and local governments, we are requiring all caregivers in all our locations to wear face masks while inside our facilities."
615,I have an appointment at Cleveland Clinic. What do I need to bring,"Please bring your appointment reminder with you (email, MyChart or text message). When entering any Cleveland Clinic location, you and any permitted visitors (see visitor restrictions) will be screened for potential COVID-19 symptoms, including a temperature scan. In some locations, we use no-contact, hand-held thermal scanners. In other places, we use a thermal imaging system you walk through and might not even notice. You’ll be asked to sanitize your hands."
617,Are all Cleveland Clinic emergency departments open,"Yes, all Cleveland Clinic emergency departments remain open for care. We encourage the public to seek immediate medical attention for symptoms that suggest serious medical emergencies, such as stroke or heart attack. All patients coming to our emergency departments are screened for COVID-19 symptoms and are required to wear a mask, unless they have a health or behavioral condition that prevents them from wearing one. This is to help maintain the health and safety of our patients and caregivers and prevent the spread of the virus. Any patients with COVID-19 symptoms are taken to a designated area within the emergency department for care."
618,What restrictions are in place for visitors going to Cleveland Clinic facilities,"We’re using four new, statewide visitation levels — yellow, orange, red and purple — to protect our patients and caregivers and limit the spread of COVID-19. The visitation levels are based on data about how COVID-19 is spreading, including state and county public health information. If you are visiting a COVID-19 positive patient, you must wear provided personal protective equipment (PPE). Even when you can’t visit in person, we encourage you to stay connected virtually."
619,Is there an online screening tool available,Yes. Cleveland Clinic launched a free COVID-19 screening tool to find out your risk level based on symptoms and travel.
620,What patients are being prioritized for testing,"Cleveland Clinic is providing drive-up and on-site testing for patients suspected of having COVID-19. Patients will need to be evaluated by a clinician using Cleveland Clinic Express Care Online or in-person, and will need a Cleveland Clinic electronic doctor’s order to be tested."
621,Why do I need a test when I’m not showing any symptoms,"One way we maintain a safe environment for our patients and caregivers is by requiring patients to undergo COVID-19 testing within three days prior to any surgery or procedure in a Cleveland Clinic operating room, ambulatory surgery center and select locations."
622,How do I get a COVID-19 test if required pre-surgery,"All patients with scheduled surgeries or procedures taking place in a Cleveland Clinic ambulatory surgery center or operating room will be tested for COVID-19 within three days, or 72 hours, prior to their surgery or procedure date. When a surgery or procedure is scheduled, a COVID-19 test will also be ordered."
623,How long will results from a COVID-19 test take,"For patients in the hospital, and those tested in our Emergency Departments who are considered very ill or at risk, results are available on average within 24 hours."

Potential impact of seasonal forcing on a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic : seasonal variation might slow down a pandemic
A spatial model of CoVID-19 transmission in England and Wales: early spread and peak timing : Seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the timing of the peak into winter months
Projecting the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 through the post-pandemic period : HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 cause annual wintertime outbreaks of respiratory illness in temperate regions (9, 10), suggesting that wintertime climate and host behaviors may facilitate transmission, as is true for influenza
Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic : If SARS-Cov-2 transmission is similarly subject to seasonal forcing, summer outbreaks would naturally have lower peaks than winter outbreaks
